iPad mini 2 32 GB 7.9 inch with Wi-Fi Only","productDescription":"Portability comes to the palm with the iPad Mini with Retina Display that balances the perfect design that Apple is renowned for with a spec line-up that promises great performance. Display 7.9 inches of Retina Display brings perfect, sharp and almost life-like visuals to the eye – watching a movie, playing a game or even just browsing through a few photos will be a pleasure considering the screen has over 3.1 million pixels on the 2048 x 1536 resolution, a million more than an HDTV and 4x better than the 1st generation iPad Mini. With LED backlighting and IPS technology, the multitouch screen makes multitasking easy. It also sports oleophobic coating ensures that what your view is not covered with fingerprints and smudges, despite constant use. Processor Powered by Apple’s home-grown A7 chip with 64-bit architecture, this iPad Mini processes functions efficiently to give you good speed. Apps you open are launched at lightning speed and the graphics-rich game runs without any hitches or lag with the A7 processor. It also supports OpenGLES v3.0 that adds more detail to the graphics and visual effects. Complementing the A7 is the M7 motion coprocessor that lends efficiency to the built-in sensors to allow the apps to adapt to the functions and give you a customized, intuitive performance and responsiveness. Battery Life Working together and dividing the load between themselves, the A7 chip and the M7 motion coprocessor ensure that there is great battery management to give you up to 10 hours of battery life. Camera Armed with the 5 megapixel iSight camera, this iPad Mini lets you frame and click crisp, bright pictures with great exposure and clarity whenever you want, wherever you are. The camera works with the image signal processor in the A7 chip to adjust the details automatically, letting you click the perfect photograph without any manual effort or adjustments. What’s more, capture the entire moment to relive at another time in full 1080p HD video with just a swipe on the screen. A 1.2 megapixel front camera allows you to video chat with a loved one with good clarity and detail; conversations look and feel better on this FaceTime HD camera. The camera features a backside illumination sensor to allow for more light to be captured, amping up the overall feel and brightness of every picture you take on this secondary camera. The device also comes with built-in dual microphones that minimizes background noise and enhances audio quality. iOS 7 The iPad Mini with Retina Display runs on iOS 7 that is designed to perfectly match the capabilities of the hardware that it packs and make full use of it. An operating system that is familiar yet simpler and smarter, the iOS 7 lets you multitask in an intelligent manner and features Siri, the voice assistant that will help you perform tasks without ever touching the tablet. With a Control Centre to aid simple functioning, Notification Centre to collate alerts and the iCloud to back-up data, the iOS 7 gives you a rounded experience. Connectivity Designed to always keep you connected, this iPad Mini comes with dual-band Wi-Fi support that makes use of two antennas and MIMO technology to ensure that you have fast browsing and download speeds of up to 300 Mbps. Sharing photos via AirDrop, catching up on your favorite shows and everything else on the web is so much faster. It is also Bluetooth-enabled that lets you share data with other Apple devices. App Store The Mini comes with pre-installed apps like the iPhoto, iMovie, GarageBand, Pages, Numbers and Keynote to start you off on your quest for utilitarian entertainment. Sensors The iPad Mini comes with a three-axis gyro and an accelerometer, sensors that work together to detect motion to allow you to play games and react intuitively when you move around. The ambient light sensor aims to adjust screen lighting according to the surroundings to ensure that the screen is just the right level of brightness for your eyes to view. Storage Capacity This iPad Mini comes with 32 GB of space which allows you to store all your apps, favorite songs, pictures and videos.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/tablet/6/a/5/apple-32-gb-ipad-mini-with-retina-display-and-wi-fi-original-imaempjmbbehxxgy.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/tablet/6/a/5/apple-32-gb-ipad-mini-with-retina-display-and-wi-fi-original-imaempjmbbehxxgy.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/tablet/6/a/5/apple-32-gb-ipad-mini-with-retina-display-and-wi-fi-original-imaempjmbbehxxgy.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["TABDR66PZPUC5VN6"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":21900,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":21900,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":21900,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/apple-ipad-mini-2-32-gb-7-9-inch-wi-fi-only/p/itmac16291ebbe2d?pid=TABDR66PZX9GD6A5&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"APPLE","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":0,"offers":["10% off on ICICI Bank Credit Cards","10% off on Axis Bank Credit Cards","10% off on ICICI Bank Debit Cards","No Cost EMI on Bajaj Finserv EMI Card","10% off on Axis Bank Debit Cards","Flat ₹100 Instant Cashback on Paytm UPI","Flat ₹100 Instant Cashback on Paytm Wallet","₹1250 off on Axis and ICICI Bank Credit Cards","₹4000 off on Axis and ICICI Bank Credit Cards","₹1250 off on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Cards","₹4000 off on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Cards","5% Cashback on Flipkart Axis Bank Card","15% off on first Pay Later Order"],"categoryPath":"Mobiles>Tablets>Tablets without Call Facility","attributes":{"size":"","color":"Silver","storage":"32 GB","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"","sellerName":"Sane Retails Private Limited","sellerAverageRating":null,"sellerNoOfRatings":0,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["1 GB RAM | 32 GB ROM","20.07 cm (7.9 inch) Quad HD Display","5 MP Primary Camera | 1.2 MP Front","iOS 7 | Battery: Lithium -

Design The iPad Air features a body that can be deemed slim, sporting a height of 9.4 inches and a width of 6.6 inches. Accompanying you in your daily life and becoming an extension of your arm, the tablet will hardly weigh you down. The aluminium unibody design deserves much more than just a passing glance - while being unobtrusive, it is also durable enough to stand the rigors of everyday existence. Display With thinner bezels and overall width, the focus will be on the content itself rather than the device. The 9.7 inch Retina display of the iPad Air, with a pixel density of 264 ppi and a screen resolution of 2048 x 1536, treats your eyes to a stunning array of colors in every visual, with just the right amount of brightness and astounding clarity. With LED backlighting and IPS technology, the multitouch screen makes multitasking easy. It also sports oleophobic coating ensures that what your view is not covered with fingerprints and smudges, despite constant use. Processor Powered by Apple's home-grown A7 chip with 64-bit architecture, this iPad Air processes functions efficiently to give you good speed. Apps you open are launched at lightning speed and the graphics-rich game runs without any hitches or lag with the A7 processor. It also supports OpenGLES v3.0 that adds more detail to the graphics and visual effects. Complementing the A7 is the M7 motion coprocessor that lends efficiency to the built-in sensors to allow the apps to adapt to the functions and give you a customized, intuitive performance and responsiveness. Camera Armed with the 5 megapixel iSight camera, this iPad Air lets you frame and click crisp, bright pictures with great exposure and clarity whenever you want, wherever you are. The camera works with the image signal processor in the A7 chip to adjust the details automatically, letting you click the perfect photograph without any manual effort or adjustments. What's more, capture the entire moment to relive at another time in full 1080p HD video with just a swipe on the screen. A 1.2 megapixel front camera, aided by dual microphones, allows you to video chat with a loved one with good clarity and detail; conversations look and feel better on this FaceTime HD camera. The camera features a backside illumination sensor to allow for more light to be captured in every frame. iOS 7 The iPad Air runs on iOS 7 that is designed to perfectly match the capabilities of the hardware that it packs and make full use of it. An operating system that is familiar yet simpler and smarter, the iOS 7 lets you multitask in an intelligent manner and features Siri, the voice assistant that will help you perform tasks without ever touching the tablet. With a Control Centre to aid simple functioning, Notification Centre to collate alerts and the iCloud to back-up data, the iOS 7 gives you a rounded experience.  Connectivity Designed to always keep you connected, this iPad Air comes with dual-band Wi-Fi support that makes use of two antennas and MIMO technology to ensure that you have fast browsing and download speeds of up to 300 Mbps. Sharing photos via AirDrop, catching up on your favorite shows and everything else on the web is so much faster. With 3G support, the iPad Air can be used not only to link up to the internet but also act as a cellular hotspot for other devices as well. It is also Bluetooth-enabled to let you share data with other Apple devices. Battery Life With efficient power and task management by the processor, the iPad Air can last up to 10 hours, allowing you ample time to ensure that you have enough juice to browse, watch videos, click pretty pictures and read your favorite books without the need to find a charging point every so often. App Store The Air comes with pre-installed apps like the iPhoto, iMovie, GarageBand, Pages, Numbers and Keynote to start you off on the quest for utilitarian entertainment. Sensors A range of sensors help the iPad Air be as intuitive as it is - a three-axis gyro acts in cohesion with an accelerometer for better motion sensing that comes in handy when you play games among other things.

iPad mini with Retina Display 64 GB 7.9 inch with Wi-Fi+3G","productDescription":"Portability comes to the palm with the iPad Mini with Retina Display that balances the perfect design that Apple is renowned for with a spec line-up that promises great performance. Display 7.9 inches of Retina Display brings perfect, sharp and almost life-like visuals to the eye - watching a movie, playing a game or even just browsing through a few photos will be a pleasure considering the screen has over 3.1 million pixels on the 2048 x 1536 resolution, a million more than an HDTV and 4x better than the 1st generation iPad Mini. With LED backlighting and IPS technology, the multitouch screen makes multitasking easy. It also sports oleophobic coating ensures that what your view is not covered with fingerprints and smudges, despite constant use. Processor Powered by Apple's home-grown A7 chip with 64-bit architecture, this iPad Mini processes functions efficiently to give you good speed. Apps you open are launched at lightning speed and the graphics-rich game runs without any hitches or lag with the A7 processor. It also supports OpenGLES v3.0 that adds more detail to the graphics and visual effects. Complementing the A7 is the M7 motion coprocessor that lends efficiency to the built-in sensors to allow the apps to adapt to the functions and give you a customized, intuitive performance and responsiveness. Battery Life Working together and dividing the load between themselves, the A7 chip and the M7 motion coprocessor ensure that there is great battery management to give you up to 10 hours of battery life. Camera Armed with the 5 megapixel iSight camera, this iPad Mini lets you frame and click crisp, bright pictures with great exposure and clarity whenever you want, wherever you are. The camera works with the image signal processor in the A7 chip to adjust the details automatically, letting you click the perfect photograph without any manual effort or adjustments. What's more, capture the entire moment to relive at another time in full 1080p HD video with just a swipe on the screen. A 1.2 megapixel front camera allows you to video chat with a loved one with good clarity and detail; conversations look and feel better on this FaceTime HD camera. The camera features a backside illumination sensor to allow for more light to be captured, amping up the overall feel and brightness of every picture you take on this secondary camera. The device also comes with built-in dual microphones that minimizes background noise and enhances audio quality. iOS 7 The iPad Mini with Retina Display runs on iOS 7 that is designed to perfectly match the capabilities of the hardware that it packs and make full use of it. An operating system that is familiar yet simpler and smarter, the iOS 7 lets you multitask in an intelligent manner and features Siri, the voice assistant that will help you perform tasks without ever touching the tablet. With a Control Centre to aid simple functioning, Notification Centre to collate alerts and the iCloud to back-up data, the iOS 7 gives you a rounded experience. Connectivity Designed to always keep you connected, this iPad Mini comes with dual-band Wi-Fi support that makes use of two antennas and MIMO technology to ensure that you have fast browsing and download speeds of up to 300 Mbps which is double the speed of the 1st generation iPad Mini. Sharing photos via AirDrop, catching up on your favorite shows and everything else on the web is so much faster. With 3G support, the iPad Mini with Retina Display can be used not only to link up to the World Wide Web but also act as a cellular hotspot for other devices as well. It is also Bluetooth-enabled to let you share data with other Apple devices. App Store The Mini comes with pre-installed apps like the iPhoto, iMovie, GarageBand, Pages, Numbers and Keynote to start you off on the quest for utilitarian entertainment. Sensors The iPad Mini comes with a three-axis gyro and an accelerometer, sensors that work together to detect motion to allow you to play games and react intuitively when you move around. The ambient light sensor aims to adjust screen lighting according to the surroundings to ensure that the screen is just the right level of bright for your eyes to view. Storage Capacity This iPad Mini comes with 64 GB of space which allows you to store all your apps, favorite songs, pictures and videos.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/tablet/p/d/y/apple-32-gb-ipad-mini-with-retina-display-and-wi-fi-cellular-original-imadr69ca2xkvhb4.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/tablet/p/d/y/apple-32-gb-ipad-mini-with-retina-display-and-wi-fi-cellular-original-imadr69ca2xkvhb4.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/tablet/p/d/y/apple-32-gb-ipad-mini-with-retina-display-and-wi-fi-cellular-original-imadr69ca2xkvhb4.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["TABDR66QG9CSAGCA","TABDR66PUNVNVYFZ","TABDR66PQRH9YCYC","TABDR66PGWKANRTN","TABDR66P3GMFE7QG","TABDR66P6XRTK7HW","TABDR66P6DJNKG39","TABDR66PKVV4ZZ9H","TABDR66PSF6NZJQY","TABDR66PZFETJYEY","TABDR66PHEXGZH34","TABDR66PXH6HWPDY"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":51900,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":51900,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":51900,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/apple-ipad-mini-retina-display-64-gb-7-9-inch-wi-fi-3g/p/itme93hfpz5wezjy?pid=TABDR66PVZBXTFFM&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"APPLE","inStock":false,"codAvailable":false,"discountPercentage":0,"offers":["10%
