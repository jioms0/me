The ultra-thin 11.9mm profile meant we had to invent the world’s most compact laptop hinge — just 3mm high — to preserve its sleek lines. To fit in the full-size keyboard, we had to create a surround that’s just 2.1mm wide at the edges, and we designed the powerful four-speaker audio system in partnership with audiophile specialists Harman Kardon. ZenBook is renowned for its unique, stunning looks, and you’ll instantly recognize the iconic Zen-inspired spun-metal finish on ZenBook 3’s all-metal unibody enclosure — a finish that takes 40 painstaking steps to create. But we’ve added a beautiful twist, using a special 2-phase anodizing process to create stunning golden edge highlights. To complete this sophisticated new theme, we’ve added a unique gold ASUS logo and given the keyboard a matching gold backlight.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/j1mggi80/computer/3/q/b/asus-zenbook-3-ultrabook-original-imaet2jhbgkntyaz.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/j1mggi80/computer/3/q/b/asus-zenbook-3-ultrabook-original-imaet2jhbgkntyaz.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/j1mggi80/computer/3/q/b/asus-zenbook-3-ultrabook-original-imaet2jhbgkntyaz.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["COMET5WMDYZJS3QB"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":122990,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":122990,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":114990,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/asus-zen-book-3-series-core-i7-7th-gen-8-gb-512-gb-ssd-windows-10-ux390ua-gs046t-thin-light-laptop/p/itmf3s32rrrz9brc?pid=COMET5WMDYZJS3QB&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"ASUS","inStock":false,"codAvailable":false,"discountPercentage":6,"offers":["10%

For the first time ever, you don’t have to make the difficult choice between portability and screen size — the incredible ZenBook UX430 achieves the impossible by delivering both! Its slim and lightweight design, iconic ZenBook styling, and high-performance components make ZenBook UX430 the take-anywhere powerhouse you won’t want to leave behind, wherever you go. Take more with you, in less space! Its sleek and compact 13-inch chassis is a briefcase-friendly 15.9mm thick, and its advanced lightweight construction keeps the weight down to just 1.25 kg. The stunning 14-inch Full HD NanoEdge display has an ultra-narrow 7.18mm bezel that allows it to fit into a svelte 13-inch chassis.A special 50Wh lithium-polymer battery gives ZenBook UX430 up to 9 hours of autonomy. Lithium-polymer batteries retain most of their original charge capacity even after hundreds of charge cycles — up to 3x longer than standard batteries — so you don't have to worry about deteriorating battery performance.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/j94ioi80/computer/7/k/r/asus-zenbook-thin-and-light-laptop-original-imaeyzpyruufyyau.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/j94ioi80/computer/7/k/r/asus-zenbook-thin-and-light-laptop-original-imaeyzpyruufyyau.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/j94ioi80/computer/7/k/r/asus-zenbook-thin-and-light-laptop-original-imaeyzpyruufyyau.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["COMEZY4XVYZHXKEH"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":81990,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":81990,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":77000,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/asus-ux430ua-core-i5-7th-gen-8-gb-512-gb-ssd-windows-10-home-ux430ua-gv223t-thin-light-laptop/p/itmf3s329xgmxawq?pid=COMEZY4XVYZHXKEH&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"ASUS","inStock":false,"codAvailable":false,"discountPercentage":6,"offers":["10% off on ICICI Bank Credit Cards","10% off on Axis Bank Credit Cards","10% off on ICICI Bank Debit Cards","On purchase of this device , get 30% off on s","10% off on Axis Bank Debit Cards","Flat ₹100 Instant Cashback on Paytm UPI","Flat ₹100 Instant Cashback on Paytm Wallet","₹1250 off on Axis and ICICI Bank Credit Cards","₹4000 off on Axis and ICICI Bank Credit Cards","₹1250 off on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Cards","₹4000 off on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Cards","5% Cashback on Flipkart Axis Bank Card","15% off on first Pay Later Order"],"categoryPath":"Computers>Laptops","attributes":{"size":"","color":"Blue","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"","sellerName":"Pankaj Goenka","sellerAverageRating":null,"sellerNoOfRatings":0,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["Intel Core i5 Processor (7th Gen)","8 GB DDR4 RAM","64 bit Windows 10 Operating System","512 GB SSD","35.56 cm (14 inch) Display"],"detailedSpecs":["Intel Core i5 Processor (7th Gen)","8 GB DDR4 RAM","64 bit Windows 10 Operating System","512 GB SSD","35.56 cm (14 inch) Display"],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Sales Package","value":["1 Laptop, 1 USB to LAN port dongle, 1 Charger, 1 Sleeve, 1 Micro HDMI to HDMI dongle"]},{"key":"Model Number","value":["UX430UA-GV223T"]},{"key":"Part Number","value":["90NB0EC5-M05280"]},{"key":"Model Name","value":["Zenbook"]},{"key":"Series","value":["UX430UA"]},{"key":"Color","value":["Blue"]},{"key":"Type","value":["Thin and Light Laptop"]},{"key":"Suitable For","value":["Travel & Business"]},{"key":"Battery Backup","value":["Upto 9 Hours"]},{"key":"Power Supply","value":["65W power adapter"]},{"key":"Battery Cell","value":["3-cell lithium-polymer battery"]},{"key":"MS Office Provided","value":["No"]}]},{"key":"Processor and Memory Features","values":[{"key":"Processor Brand","value":["Intel"]},{"key":"Processor Name","value":["Core i5"]},{"key":"Processor Generation","value":["7th Gen"]},{"key":"SSD","value":["Yes"]},{"key":"SSD Capacity","value":["512 GB"]},{"key":"RAM","value":["8 GB"]},{"key":"RAM Type","value":["DDR4"]},{"key":"Processor Variant","value":["7200U"]},{"key":"Clock Speed","value":["2.5 GHz"]},{"key":"RAM Frequency","value":["2133 MHz"]},{"key":"Cache","value":["3 MB"]},{"key":"Graphic Processor","value":["Intel Integrated HD620"]}]},{"key":"Operating System","values":[{"key":"OS Architecture","value":["64 bit"]},{"key":"Operating System","value":["Windows 10 Home"]},{"key":"Supported Operating System","value":["Windows 10"]}]},{"key":"Port and Slot Features","values":[{"key":"USB Port","value":["1 x Type-CTM USB 3.1 / 1 x Type-A USB 3.1 / 1 x USB 2.0"]},{"key":"HDMI Port","value":["1 x Micro HDMI"]},{"key":"Multi Card Slot","value":["1 x SD Card reader"]}]},{"key":"Display and Audio Features","values":[{"key":"Touchscreen","value":["No"]},{"key":"Screen Size","value":["35.56 cm (14 inch)"]},{"key":"Screen Resolution","value":["1920 x 1080 pixel"]},{"key":"Screen Type","value":["14″ NanoEdge anti-glare LED-backlit with 178˚ wide-view technology;

and performance. Available in multiple colors and finishes, Vivo Book 15 is a Windows 10 laptop powered by the latest Generation Intel Core i5 processor and NVIDIA GeForce MX130 graphics. ASUS Vivo Book 15 is thinner and lighter than ever: It weighs just 1.7 kg and has an amazingly thin 19.4mm profile. It’s an everyday laptop with the weight and compactness of an Ultrabook. Fitting a 39.62cm(15.6-inch) Full HD display into a frame size that’s typical of a 14-inch laptop isn’t easy – but the ultrathin bezel of the Nano Edge display on the Vivo Book 15 makes it possible. It’s the perfect solution for sharing content with friends and colleagues.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/jq189e80/computer/b/q/6/asus-x510uf-laptop-original-imafbxg9kfkufsb8.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/jq189e80/computer/b/q/6/asus-x510uf-laptop-original-imafbxg9kfkufsb8.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/jq189e80/computer/b/q/6/asus-x510uf-laptop-original-imafbxg9kfkufsb8.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["COMFC5Y9WKEB2BQ6"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":58990,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":58990,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":45990,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/asus-vivobook-core-i5-8th-gen-4-gb-16-optane-1-tb-hdd-windows-10-home-2-graphics-x510uf-ej610t-laptop/p/itmfc55bux53e4v6?pid=COMFC5Y9WKEB2BQ6&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"ASUS","inStock":false,"codAvailable":false,"discountPercentage":27,"offers":["10%

represents who you are, it’s the youthful and vivacious ASUS VivoBook Series. The new VivoBook S15 adds a dash of personality to your mobile lifestyle, featuring a bold new lightweight design with unique color combinations, a choice of textured finishes, and the innovative three-sided NanoEdge display and ErgoLift hinge. Like every other VivoBook before it, S15 offers a combination of performance, style, and comfort to help you get the job done, wherever you are.The new NanoEdge display on VivoBook S15 continues to push the boundaries of what’s possible — the new three-sided NanoEdge display now has an even narrower bezel along the top and sides of the display. This results in an 86% screen-to-body ratio that provides unrivaled immersion in a much more compact package. And when you throw wide viewing angles and exceptional color reproduction into the mix, every visual task is made easier. Entertainment is simply more awesome with S15!","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/jri3jww0/computer/e/z/z/asus-s530un-bq031t-laptop-original-imafd85mfsrf5bhh.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/jri3jww0/computer/e/z/z/asus-s530un-bq031t-laptop-original-imafd85mfsrf5bhh.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/jri3jww0/computer/e/z/z/asus-s530un-bq031t-laptop-original-imafd85mfsrf5bhh.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["COMFD86HVZ2TDEZZ"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":92990,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":92990,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":65990,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/asus-s530un-core-i7-8th-gen-8-gb-1-tb-hdd-256-gb-ssd-windows-10-home-4-graphics-s530un-bq031t-laptop/p/itmfd9vpdz6hbynn?pid=COMFD86HVZ2TDEZZ&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"ASUS","inStock":false,"codAvailable":false,"discountPercentage":29,"offers":["10%
