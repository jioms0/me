Steamers are often used by clothing companies and clothing stores to prepare garments for sale or display. They are meant to function as a fast and effective substitute for ironing. The speed with which a garment steamer releases wrinkles from an article of clothing is especially important in commercial and industrial use when hundreds of garments may require attention in a single day.The garment steamer has a water well at the base, a long metal rod that extends up to five feet (about 1.5 meters) above the base, and a flexible rubber tube that carries the steam from the base up to a wide nozzle. When the steamer is plugged in, the water in the base begins to heat up quickly, creating steam which rises through the tube and out through the nozzle. The tall rod is designed so that a garment can be hung upon it with a hanger.Once the garment has been hung on the rod and the steam has begun to rise, the nozzle can be brushed over a wrinkled garment. Many people know the trick of hanging a wrinkled garment in the bathroom while showering in order to release wrinkles. A garment steamer functions on the same principle, but the steam is more concentrated. Depending on how deeply wrinkled a piece of clothing is and how thick its material is, the time that it takes to steam a garment varies. This time also varies based on the power and quality of the garment steamer as well as the size of the item of clothing. Many garments made of cotton, wool, and blends including these two types of fibers can be completely steamed in a minute or less.While garment steamers are most commonly used for commercial and industrial purposes, there are models that are intended for personal use at home. In fact, there are also some very compact models that can be used while traveling. This can be particularly helpful for people who travel on a regular basis for professional reasons. Hotel ironing services can be quite expensive and a good portable garment steamer can remove wrinkles from suits and dresses that have spent hours or even days crammed into a suitcase.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/iron/r/p/2/skyline-skyline-vtl-5100-1500w-white-grey-original-imaeewheyhrgcvgq.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/iron/r/p/2/skyline-skyline-vtl-5100-1500w-white-grey-original-imaeewheyhrgcvgq.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/iron/r/p/2/skyline-skyline-vtl-5100-1500w-white-grey-original-imaeewheyhrgcvgq.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["IRNEF39KTXSYZRP2"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":4999,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":4999,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":3999,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/skyline-vtl-5100-1500w-white-grey-1500-w-garment-steamer/p/itm89324038153d6?pid=IRNEF39KTXSYZRP2&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"Skyline","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":20,"offers":["10% off on ICICI Bank Credit Cards,","10% off on ICICI Bank Credit Card EMI","5% Cashback on Flipkart Axis Bank Card","Shop & Earn Pass - Buy 101 Gift Voucher","20%off on 1st txn with Amex Network Cards T&C","10% Off on BOB Mastercard debit card","10% Off on ICICI Bank Mastercard Credit Card","₹50 Off on ICICI Bank Mastercard Debit Card"],"categoryPath":"Electronics>Appliances>Home Appliances>Iron","attributes":{"size":"","color":"White & Grey","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"","sellerName":"Shalini Singh","sellerAverageRating":null,"sellerNoOfRatings":0,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["Garment Steamer Iron","Garment Steamer Plate","Consumes 1500 W","Has Steam Burst"],"detailedSpecs":["Garment Steamer Iron","Garment Steamer Plate","Consumes 1500 W","Has Steam Burst"],"specificationList":[{"key":"In The Box","values":[{"key":"Sales Package","value":["1 Pc.

Save yourself the trouble by getting this Oster steam iron. Now, you can press your garments at home without worrying about losing them.  Non-stick Sole Plate This feature ensures that the iron glides smoothly on your clothes while pressing and doesn’t stick to your garments. Spray Mist and Steam Shot Function From tough creases on your shirts to soft wrinkles on your curtains, you can remove them all with the help of its spray mist and shot of steam features. The extra boost of steam will dampen your clothes and give a crisp finish to them after ironing. Body Design To help you iron the clothes comfortably, this appliance is designed with an ergonomic handle. It has a 120 ml-big, see-through water tank which helps you check the water level without opening the reservoir door.

In the heart of the winter when the temperature dips, how would a warm blow of air feel like? Comforting. This is exactly what this Orpat OFR OOH 11 Room Heater makes you feel. The oil-filled radiator with adjustable thermostat will make you quite forget about the winter. As you find comfort in the warm and mellow environment, take pride in noting that this oil-filled radiator, which is a superior type of a room heater is silent in operation and comes with a tip over switch that shuts the heater off to prevent shock or fire if it tilts more than a specified angle while in operation. The fans used in the OFR do not kick up dust in the room. The OFR continues to radiate heat for some time even after being switched off. That way, the room stays warm for a longer time. Moreover, with caster wheels and a mounting plate, it becomes easy to shift it across the room. It has a relatively low operational cost. What’s more, it is stylish and elegant.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/js0o9zk0/room-heater/f/v/p/ofr-ooh-11-orpat-original-imafdhrzdhamyjd9.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/js0o9zk0/room-heater/f/v/p/ofr-ooh-11-orpat-original-imafdhrzdhamyjd9.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/js0o9zk0/room-heater/f/v/p/ofr-ooh-11-orpat-original-imafdhrzdhamyjd9.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["ROHEP8HXT3HQGFVP"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":6499,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":6499,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":6199,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/orpat-ofr-ooh-11-oil-filled-room-heater/p/itmep8hx5wevpq86?pid=ROHEP8HXT3HQGFVP&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"ORPAT","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":4,"offers":["5%

And waking up in the morning is going to be easier as your fan will switch off automatically, so you are not tempted to catch a few more winks. Includes Remote Control No, you don’t have to sacrifice comfort as you are lazy to walk all the way to the fan. All you have to do is point the remote control that comes along with the fan and adjust the settings before you go back to sleep. Motorized Oscillation Sit in a circle and feast on Tandoori chicken and beer with your roomies while you all enjoy the breeze from the fan with the 90 degree motorized oscillation.  Breeze And Sleep Modes Nights can get chilli every hour. And waking up shivering at two in the night can be annoying, especially for those who find it hard to sleep. This is why the fan has the sleep mode, where the breeze gets lowered after some point of time in the night, letting you sleep soundly till morning. Low Sound Level With a low sound level of 46dB, you can study comfortably for your semester exams with this fan next to you.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/fan/h/n/z/bionaire-bt150r-original-imaegmhf6hugcmcf.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/fan/h/n/z/bionaire-bt150r-original-imaegmhf6hugcmcf.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/fan/h/n/z/bionaire-bt150r-original-imaegmhf6hugcmcf.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["FANEGMQ4J7ADFHNZ"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":5695,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":5695,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":5695,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/bionaire-bt150r-1-blade-tower-fan/p/itme49b78e6f4fc4?pid=FANEGMQ4J7ADFHNZ&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"Bionaire","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":0,"offers":["Flat INR 5000 Off on ICICI Bank Credit Cards","5% Cashback on Flipkart Axis Bank Card","20%off on 1st txn with Amex Network Cards T&C","Purchase this Product and get","10% Off on BOB Mastercard debit card","10% Off on ICICI Bank Mastercard Credit Card","₹50 Off on ICICI Bank Mastercard Debit Card","₹100 Off on First Pay Later Transaction"],"categoryPath":"Electronics>Appliances>Home Appliances>Fans","attributes":{"size":"","color":"Black","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"","sellerName":"Tirupati Biz Link LLP","sellerAverageRating":null,"sellerNoOfRatings":0,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["Type: Tower Fan","Motor Speed: 100 RPM","Power Consumption: 40 W","Blade Sweep Size: 0 mm","Number of Speed Settings: 3","Material: ABS"],"detailedSpecs":["Type: Tower Fan","Motor Speed: 100 RPM","Power Consumption: 40 W","Blade Sweep Size: 0 mm","Number of Speed Settings: 3","Material: ABS"],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Model Name","value":["BT150R"]},{"key":"Brand Color","value":["Black"]},{"key":"Number of Blades","value":["1"]},{"key":"Pack of","value":["1"]}]},{"key":"Product Details","values":[{"key":"Suitable For","value":["Room, Office"]},{"key":"Other Features","value":["3 speed oscillation\nDigital control with 8 hours timer\nRemote control\nBreeze & Sleep mode\nCE safety standard"]},{"key":"Sales Package","value":["Main Unit, Remote Control, Warranty Card"]}]},{"key":"Dimensions","values":[{"key":"Weight","value":["3.5 kg"]}]},{"key":"Warranty","values":[{"key":"Covered in Warranty","value":["Warranty of the product is limited to manufacturing defects only."]},{"key":"Warranty Service Type","value":["On-site Service, Customer needs to call the nearby Authorized Service Center, service engineer will come to the site to get the product repaired or inspected."]},{"key":"Not Covered in Warranty","value":["Warranty does not cover any external accessories (such as battery, cable, carrying bag), damage caused to the product due to improper installation by customer."]},{"key":"Warranty Summary","value":["2 Year Company Warranty"]},{"key":"Domestic Warranty","value":["2 Year"]},{"key":"International Warranty","value":["2 Year"]}]}],"booksInfo":{"language":null,"binding":null,"pages":null,"publisher":null,"year":0,"authors":[]},"lifeStyleInfo":{"sleeve":null,"neck":null,"idealFor":null}}},{"productBaseInfoV1":{"productId":"IRNEB8FY9MZ6X8KK","title":"Premier Ruby PDI -

The highly sensitive pyro-sensor gives it coverage of 360 at the aperture angle of 120 with the detection reach of 6 meters. It is most suitable for medium sized covered areas. It has highly sensitive pyro-sensor operating as the heart of its system. It detects heat radiated from a body. Segmented lenses divide the whole detection area into passive and active zones. When any warm object like human body moves between the zones, it is detected as a change in voltage by the pyro-sensor. When it detects such movement, it triggers the switching mechanism to operate the connected load. As the pyro-sensor operates by detecting change in the temperature, the ambient temperature plays important role in working of this motion sensor. Maximum detection reach distance mentioned in the technical specifications is measured at the ambient temperature of 25⁰ C. Detection reach distance might change with the change in ambient temperature.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/sensor-security-system/9/v/k/ir-c2360-welit-original-imae5twchjurhcds.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/sensor-security-system/9/v/k/ir-c2360-welit-original-imae5twchjurhcds.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/sensor-security-system/9/v/k/ir-c2360-welit-original-imae5twchjurhcds.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["SSSE5UVG73X4U9VK"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":1550,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":1550,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":799,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/welit-ir-c2360-wired-sensor-security-system/p/itme5uvgvhfgnt2b?pid=SSSE5UVG73X4U9VK&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"Welit","inStock":true,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":48,"offers":["5%
