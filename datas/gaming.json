The Thrustmaster Universal Challenge 5 in 1 Racing Wheel comes with a steering wheel and a set of pedals that correspond to braking and acceleration.

The Thrustmaster Universal Challenge 5 in 1 Racing Wheel is compatible with the Personal Computer, Play Station 2, Play Station 3 and also the Wii. This means that you can use this racing wheel with all sorts of consoles made by major brands and has a wide range of games that are compatible with the Wheel.

The associated footrest provided with the pedal assembly allows for precision control and comfortable foot placement during races. The attachment system provided with the assembly ensures that you are able to fix the device in a stable manner. The sensitivity of the wheel is adjustable as well.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/jbl3zbk0/joystick/3/h/8/thrustmaster-thrustmaster-ferrari-458-italia-x-box-racing-wheel-original-imafywsdfyd2fz3b.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/jbl3zbk0/joystick/3/h/8/thrustmaster-thrustmaster-ferrari-458-italia-x-box-racing-wheel-original-imafywsdfyd2fz3b.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/jbl3zbk0/joystick/3/h/8/thrustmaster-thrustmaster-ferrari-458-italia-x-box-racing-wheel-original-imafywsdfyd2fz3b.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["ACCDFFA6NCZXY3H8"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":11620,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":11620,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":11620,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/thrustmaster-ferrari-458-italia-x-box-racing-wheel/p/itm253bd1547e963?pid=ACCDFFA6NCZXY3H8&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"THRUSTMASTER","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":0,"offers":["10%

Light(for PC)","productDescription":"When the dead begin to walk with a ravenous appetite for human flesh, your only hope for survival is to kill, or you will be killed. Developed by Techland and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, Dying Light is a survival horror, action role-playing video game that offers, both, the single-player and multiplayer modes. This game received a provisional rating of 18 from PEGI and this disc is meant for the Xbox One console. Set in a dystopian post-apocalyptic metropolis that is infested with zombie-like beings that were once human, Dying Light follows Kyle Crane, an undercover operative, who is sent to a fictional city called Harran to infiltrate the quarantine zone so as to locate a rogue agent named Kadir \"Rais\" Sulaiman. Kadir holds a file that could damage the reputation of Kyle’s agency. Once Kyle arrives at the quarantine zone he is confronted by a choice - complete assigned missions or help other survivors. The gameplay of Dying Light sees the player assuming the role of Kyle Crane. Travel the dark, open-world urban environment of Harran which is overrun by zombies that are more aggressive at night. There are also other creatures called the predators that only come out at night; they are far more vicious and horrendous than the typical zombies. Scavenge the urban environment for useful resources and craft weapons to keep yourself safe. You can choose from over 100 weapons, such as bats, knives, axes and sledgehammers, to battle the ruthless zombies; most of these weapons are meant for melee combat. The featured crafting system allows you to create a host of innovative weapons, like a wrench that’s wrapped in an electrified barbed wire. Freerun from building to building, grapple up walls and pounce on unsuspecting foes to stay alive. Up to four players can play together online in the co-op mode. “Be the Zombie”, a unique game mode, lets you play as a zombie in other players’ worlds. What else can be said when nightmarish creatures lurk in the shadows at dusk but good night and good luck?","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/physical-game/g/8/d/pc-dying-light-original-imaef94auygyxkv6.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/physical-game/g/8/d/pc-dying-light-original-imaef94auygyxkv6.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/physical-game/g/8/d/pc-dying-light-original-imaef94auygyxkv6.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["GAMEF3QZA8YNJYHJ","GAME2EFSRYRHHUW3","GAMEF3QZXEVDHXJ8","GAME2EFSPPHM88NC","GAMEF3QZPBRWJG8D"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":999,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":999,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":999,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/dying-light/p/itmef3qpgjgz8qxh?pid=GAMEF3QZPBRWJG8D&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":0,"offers":["10% off on ICICI Bank Credit Cards","10% off on Axis Bank Credit Cards","10% off on ICICI Bank Debit Cards","Buy 2 Save 5%, Buy 3 Save 10%","No Cost EMI on Bajaj Finserv EMI Card","10% off on Axis Bank Debit Cards","Flat ₹100 Instant Cashback on Paytm UPI","Flat ₹100 Instant Cashback on Paytm Wallet","₹1250 off on Axis and ICICI Bank Credit Cards","₹4000 off on Axis and ICICI Bank Credit Cards","₹1250 off on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Cards","₹4000 off on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Cards","5% Cashback on Flipkart Axis Bank Card","15% off on first Pay Later Order"],"categoryPath":"Gaming>PC>Games>Physical Games","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"","sellerName":"Satvinder Singh","sellerAverageRating":null,"sellerNoOfRatings":0,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["Platform: PC","Genre: Action"],"detailedSpecs":["Platform: PC","Genre: Action"],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Title Name","value":["Dying Light"]},{"key":"Platform","value":["PC"]},{"key":"Genre","value":["Action"]},{"key":"Publisher","value":["Warner Bros.

Support for 4K allows the HDMI interface to transmit digital content at the same resolution as the state-of-the-art Digital Cinema systems used in many movie theaters.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/tv-out-cable/high-speed-with-ethernet-hdmi-cable/m/s/v/c-e-cne60706-original-imaedkqdxmzzdwnp.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/tv-out-cable/high-speed-with-ethernet-hdmi-cable/m/s/v/c-e-cne60706-original-imaedkqdxmzzdwnp.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/tv-out-cable/high-speed-with-ethernet-hdmi-cable/m/s/v/c-e-cne60706-original-imaedkqdxmzzdwnp.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["ACCECB925ZUT7GZV"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":3745,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":3745,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":1849,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/c-e-tv-out-cable-cne66951/p/itmecb92kdtzzzqp?pid=ACCECB925ZUT7GZV&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"C&E","inStock":true,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":50,"offers":["Flat INR 5000 Off on ICICI Bank Credit Cards","5% Cashback on Flipkart Axis Bank Card","20%off on 1st txn with Amex Network Cards T&C","10% Off on BOB Mastercard debit card","₹50 Off on ICICI Bank Mastercard Debit Card","₹100 Off on First Pay Later Transaction"],"categoryPath":"Electronics>Entertainment>Gaming consoles>Accessories>TV-out Cable Accessories","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"Usually Delivered within 4 days.","sellerName":"Sachin Ghai","sellerAverageRating":null,"sellerNoOfRatings":0,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["High Speed with Ethernet HDMI cable","For TV","HDMI Interface","Suitable For: Video Output, Audio Output","0.9144 m Cable Length"],"detailedSpecs":["High Speed with Ethernet HDMI cable","For TV","HDMI Interface","Suitable For: Video Output, Audio Output","0.9144 m Cable Length"],"specificationList":[{"key":"General Specifications","values":[{"key":"Brand","value":["C&E"]},{"key":"Color","value":["Black"]},{"key":"Cable Length","value":["0.9144 m"]},{"key":"Interface(Connectors)","value":["HDMI"]},{"key":"Interface","value":["HDMI"]},{"key":"Material","value":["Rubber"]},{"key":"Model","value":["CNE66951"]},{"key":"In The Box","value":["5 Pack 3 Feet Hdmi Cable"]},{"key":"Type","value":["High Speed with Ethernet HDMI cable"]},{"key":"Platform","value":["TV"]},{"key":"Weight","value":["2267.96 g"]}]}],"booksInfo":{"language":null,"binding":null,"pages":null,"publisher":null,"year":0,"authors":[]},"lifeStyleInfo":{"sleeve":null,"neck":null,"idealFor":null}}},{"productBaseInfoV1":{"productId":"ACCEHQUBZ758CZPK","title":"C&E  TV-out Cable High Speed HDMI Extension Cable Male -

A single-player turn-based role-playing video game for the PC that was developed by Obsidian Entertainment and South Park Digital Studios and published by Ubisoft, South Park: The Stick Of Truth is based on the adult animated television series South Park. The plot of this game follows the protagonist, The New Kid, who is introduced to the world of madness that is the live-action role-playing fantasy of the twisted young ones of South Park who have been thoroughly gripped by the imaginary world that they have created for themselves. Two factions of the children of South Park battle it out to obtain and keep the Stick of Truth, an object of great power that allows its wielder to control space and time. The whole game is brimming with outrageous comedy that’ll make you laugh your hats off. Featuring an open-world South Park, you get to explore the nooks and crannies of the diverse and strange town while experience 14 hours worth of humour that stems from 17 of South Park’s TV seasons. Rated 18 by PEGI, you can chose from an array of unconventional characters to play as, such as, an American football helmet-wearing combatant who stuns his enemies by kicking their crotch region or a Jew whose special ability involves the use of a scalpel to circumcise and maim his enemies. With loads of weapons and armor sets that can be used, all of which can be enhanced by applying stickers on them, this game is an amusing and epic voyage.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/av-media/games/s/k/e/south-park-the-stick-of-truth-original-imaefjzhnsr2n88g.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/av-media/games/s/k/e/south-park-the-stick-of-truth-original-imaefjzhnsr2n88g.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/av-media/games/s/k/e/south-park-the-stick-of-truth-original-imaefjzhnsr2n88g.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["AVMDF2B9ZJMZCZXA","AVMDF2B9SJD8GFZH"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":999,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":999,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":999,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/south-park-stick-truth/p/itmegyzhvhfgvgjz?pid=AVMDF2B9JBRJWSKE&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":0,"offers":["10% off on ICICI Bank Credit Cards","10% off on Axis Bank Credit Cards","10% off on ICICI Bank Debit Cards","Buy 2 Save 5%, Buy 3 Save 10%","No Cost EMI on Bajaj Finserv EMI Card","10% off on Axis Bank Debit Cards","Flat ₹100 Instant Cashback on Paytm UPI","Flat ₹100 Instant Cashback on Paytm Wallet","₹1250 off on Axis and ICICI Bank Credit Cards","₹4000 off on Axis and ICICI Bank Credit Cards","₹1250 off on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Cards","₹4000 off on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Cards","5% Cashback on Flipkart Axis Bank Card","15% off on first Pay Later Order"],"categoryPath":"Gaming>Games>PS3 Games>PS3 Physical Games","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"","sellerName":"Satvinder Singh","sellerAverageRating":null,"sellerNoOfRatings":0,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["Platform: PS3","Genre: RPG","Edition: Standard Edition","Game Modes: Single-Player"],"detailedSpecs":["Platform: PS3","Genre: RPG","Edition: Standard Edition","Game Modes: Single-Player"],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Title Name","value":["South Park: The Stick Of Truth"]},{"key":"Platform","value":["PS3"]},{"key":"Edition","value":["Standard Edition"]},{"key":"Type","value":["Full Game"]},{"key":"Genre","value":["RPG"]},{"key":"Game Modes","value":["Single-Player"]},{"key":"Publisher","value":["Ubisoft"]}]}],"booksInfo":{"language":null,"binding":null,"pages":null,"publisher":"Ubisoft","year":0,"authors":[]},"lifeStyleInfo":{"sleeve":null,"neck":null,"idealFor":null}}},{"productBaseInfoV1":{"productId":"AVMDU5RGCWNZJ4UK","title":"Lego The Hobbit : The Video Game(for PS4)","productDescription":"You are invited to be a part of an adventure of epic proportions, one that will decide the fate of a diverse fantasy world that is filled with magic and wonders beyond one’s wildest imagination.

Developed by NetherRealm Studios and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, Mortal Kombat X is a single-player/multiplayer fighting game for the PC. This game runs on a modified version of the Unreal Engine 3. There is no ESRB/PEGI rating for this game yet. Mortal Kombat X features a fresh, authentic and non-linear storyline. The plot of this game ensues from where the previous installment left off, hence, a lot of focus is on veteran warriors and the next-generation of fighters. The following are four new fighters who have been introduced to the Mortal Kombat franchise: Cassie Cage, the daughter of Sonya Blade and Johnny Cage; D’Vorah, a female who commands insects; Kotal Khan, a blood god, and Ferra/Torr, a duo comprising of a massive masked brute and a dwarf-woman. There are three different variants for each character in this game; each variant wields a distinct skill set. Similar to previous games in this series, Mortal Kombat X’s gameplay sees two players fighting each other to the death with an array of special moves, attacks and brutal Fatalities. First implemented in the previous title of this game series, the energy meter allows players to execute X-Ray moves; some adjustments have been made to this system. As in Injustice: Gods Among Us, players will now be able to interact with their environment much more - players can use objects in their surroundings and will reposition themselves when they bounce off certain areas.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/av-media/games/h/f/b/mortal-kombat-x-original-imadx6zg5ggbxyvz.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/av-media/games/h/f/b/mortal-kombat-x-original-imadx6zg5ggbxyvz.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/av-media/games/h/f/b/mortal-kombat-x-original-imadx6zg5ggbxyvz.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["AVMDX5EA95BRYDZA","AVMDX5EAM9E3KEVF"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":2999,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":2999,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":2999,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/mortal-kombat-x/p/itmegyzh6zqxb3m6?pid=AVMDX5EAHCGFYHFB&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":0,"offers":["10% off on ICICI Bank Credit Cards","10% off on Axis Bank Credit Cards","10% off on ICICI Bank Debit Cards","No Cost EMI on Bajaj Finserv EMI Card","10% off on Axis Bank Debit Cards","Flat ₹100 Instant Cashback on Paytm UPI","Flat ₹100 Instant Cashback on Paytm Wallet","₹1250 off on Axis and ICICI Bank Credit Cards","₹4000 off on Axis and ICICI Bank Credit Cards","₹1250 off on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Cards","₹4000 off on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Cards","5% Cashback on Flipkart Axis Bank Card","15% off on first Pay Later Order"],"categoryPath":"Gaming>Games>PS3 Games>PS3 Physical Games","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"","sellerName":"Satvinder Singh","sellerAverageRating":null,"sellerNoOfRatings":0,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["Platform: PS3","Genre: Action","Edition: Standard Edition","Game Modes: Multi-Player, Single-Player"],"detailedSpecs":["Platform: PS3","Genre: Action","Edition: Standard Edition","Game Modes: Multi-Player, Single-Player"],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Title Name","value":["Mortal Kombat X"]},{"key":"Platform","value":["PS3"]},{"key":"Edition","value":["Standard Edition"]},{"key":"Type","value":["Full Game"]},{"key":"Genre","value":["Action"]},{"key":"Game Modes","value":["Multi-Player, Single-Player"]},{"key":"Publisher","value":["Warner Bros.

Each console has been a definitive leap forward in terms of gaming technology and graphics. The PlayStation 3 or the PS3 as it is more commonly known has been more successful than its predecessors thanks to the wide range of games available for it. The upcoming PS4 release is perhaps the most anticipated of all releases a gaming console has ever had. Connectivity Options You have the choice of USB 3.0 connections for controllers and accessories or you can go in for the HDMI connection that is necessary to connect the functional console to the display output, like an HD enabled Television. The PlayStation 4 is well on the way to becoming one of the most popular new releases in terms of gaming equipment and peripherals. You can easily Buy the PS4 online after its release later this year. Connecting to the internet is simple enough, with an Ethernet port allowing seamless internet connectivity. You also get a Bluetooth Connection which will help in pairing compatible accessories with it. The console also supports Wireless Connectivity for easy access. Memory Capacity The PlayStation IV comes with a hefty 500 GB Internal Hard Drive. This massive Drive is more than sufficient for storing all your online games and offline game saves. The more space available to the user, the more game saves and online copies can be stored in it. Graphics and Processing The PS4 is slated to come with a powerful and efficient Single Chip Custom Processor, mainly the Low Power x86 – 64 AMD Jaguar. You also have an 8 Core CPU. The GPU comes with a 1.84 TFlops clock speed. That is one of the fastest GPUs available for consoles thus far. The Next Generation Radeon Based Graphics Engine will help in rendering the newer games in far greater detail and clarity. You also get a GDDR5 8 GB Memory which will help in improving memory based functions like quick interface options and processing supported by RAM and a host of other features.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/gamingconsole/g/a/t/playstation-4-ps4-500-sony-dualshock-4-controller-original-imadrhehpvvetkgf.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/gamingconsole/g/a/t/playstation-4-ps4-500-sony-dualshock-4-controller-original-imadrhehpvvetkgf.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/gamingconsole/g/a/t/playstation-4-ps4-500-sony-dualshock-4-controller-original-imadrhehpvvetkgf.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["GMCDNZCHPFVHKGAT"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":36309,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":36309,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":27990,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/sony-playstation-4-ps4-500-gb/p/itmdrnshthv9egmf?pid=GMCDNZCHPFVHKGAT&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"SONY","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":22,"offers":["5% Cashback on Flipkart Axis Bank Card","No Cost EMI on Bajaj Finserv EMI Card"],"categoryPath":"Gaming>Gaming Consoles>PS4","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"500 GB","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"","sellerName":"Satvinder Singh","sellerAverageRating":null,"sellerNoOfRatings":0,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["PS4","Ethernet Available, Bluetooth Available"],"detailedSpecs":["PS4","Ethernet Available, Bluetooth Available"],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Model Number","value":["PlayStation 4 (PS4)"]},{"key":"Sales Package","value":["1 Unit of PlayStation 4 Console, DualShock 4 Controller, Mono Headset, HDMI Cable, Power Cable, DualShock 4 Charger Cable (USB to micro USB), Quick Guide"]},{"key":"Console Type","value":["Console"]},{"key":"HDMI","value":["1"]},{"key":"Processor","value":["x86-64 AMD Jaguar, 8 cores"]},{"key":"USB","value":["2"]},{"key":"Hard Disk","value":["500 GB"]},{"key":"Graphics","value":["1.84 TFLOPS, AMD Next Generation Radeon Based Graphics Engine"]},{"key":"WLAN","value":["IEEE 802.11 b/g/n"]},{"key":"Motion Controller Included","value":["DualShock 4 Controller"]},{"key":"Weight","value":["2800 g"]},{"key":"Other Features","value":["Single-chip Custom Processor, CPU: Low Power x86 - 64 AMD Jaguar, 8 Cores, GPU: 1.84 TFLOPS, AMD Next-generation Radeon Based Graphics Engine, GDDR5 8 GB Memory, BD x 6 CAV Drive (Read Only), DVD x 8 CAV Drive (Read Only), Input / Output: Super-speed USB, AUX Port x 1, Bluetooth 2.1 (EDR), AV Output: Digital Output (Optical) Port"]}]},{"key":"Warranty","values":[{"key":"Warranty Summary","value":["1 Year Domestic Warranty"]},{"key":"Warranty Service Type","value":["If there is Any Technical Issue with the Products Kindly Contact the Service Center of the Concerned Brand"]},{"key":"Covered in Warranty","value":["Warranty of the product is limited to manufacturing defects only"]},{"key":"Not Covered in Warranty","value":["NA"]}]}],"booksInfo":{"language":null,"binding":null,"pages":null,"publisher":null,"year":0,"authors":[]},"lifeStyleInfo":{"sleeve":null,"neck":null,"idealFor":null}}},{"productBaseInfoV1":{"productId":"ACCEDEABUFHVNZHZ","title":"ASUS ROG Gladius Wired Optical  Gaming Mouse(USB, Grey)","productDescription":"Rog Gladius Is An Optical Wired Gaming Mouse Engineered With Perfect Right-Hand Ergonomics For First-Person Shooter (Fps) Mastery!

: Boy Warrior(for PS2)","productDescription":"This story is a classic \"Good versus Evil\" story. It is a \"growing up\" story of Hanuman. He starts as a powerless monkey and regains his powers through the game. He learns about the exploits of Hanuman & never realizes that everyone is talking about his exploits till the moment of truth when that realization dawns on him. So the key theme here is the emergence of a hero & the message that one can become a hero through bravery & justness of their actions. There are a number of defining moments in the story. Bal Hanuman's discovery that he is actually Hanuman, the regaining of his powers one by one; and the final Wow moment where Hanuman is standing on a hilltop with a bright sun in the sky. Lastly the fact that Hanuman never kills his adversaries only frees them (Soul) of their bad Karma is a defining moment in the

Performance and Connectivity The PlayStation 3, right from the first ever launched model, has always been appreciated and hailed for its multiple options for external connectivity. On the PS3 500 GB, Sony has taken this connectivity features to another level with the inclusion of a built-in memory card reader. The other connectivity avenues on this console include Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and Ethernet port for internet connectivity along with an HDMI port and an AV multi output port. This HDMI port, with the help of a high speed HDMI is capable of supporting video resolutions of up to 1080p as well as 3D video content. The internet connectivity on this Sony PlayStation 3 500 GB is through Wi-Fi or an Ethernet cable, which lets you browse the internet with its very own browser and also allows you to download online material like game demos or game updates. Controllers and Joysticks The PS3 500 GB console comes with a motion-sensitive DUALSHOCK 3 wireless controller that connects to the console via Bluetooth. This means you no longer will get the wires in a knot nor will you have a set distance limit from the console due to the length of the controller cable. The layout of the controller stays the same as on the previous models with pressure sensitive buttons and the force-feedback that make sure that you feel right in the middle of your game sequence.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/gamingconsole/n/h/v/playstation-3-ps3-500-sony-original-imaeygkkddvc6tws.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/gamingconsole/n/h/v/playstation-3-ps3-500-sony-original-imaeygkkddvc6tws.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/gamingconsole/n/h/v/playstation-3-ps3-500-sony-original-imaeygkkddvc6tws.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["GMCDEUF2VF6F3NHV"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":22990,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":22990,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":22990,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/sony-playstation-3-ps3-500-gb-famous-uncharted-drake-s-fortune-heavenly-sword/p/itmeb2pkbbqzm62x?pid=GMCDEUF2VF6F3NHV&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"SONY","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":0,"offers":["5%

They are backward compatible to all previous versions.Main Features:* 1080p Resolution. Audio Return Channel 3D - 3D is the latest rage for both home theater and gaming.* 4K - The 4K resolution is 3840 x 2160 pixels @ 24 Hz.* Deep Color - The Deep Color feature provides a minimum of 8-bits per color element (24-bits total), providing for a total of over 16 million color variations. x.v.Color - x.v.Color High Definition Audio - HDMI supports a full range of high definition audio types, including SA-CD, DVD-Audio, DTS-HD Master Audio, and Dolby TrueHD.Specifications:*Our High Speed HDMI cables with Ethernet have been designed to meet the performance standards set by HDMI 2.0 and have passed stringent Category 2 testing. They are backward compatible to all previous versions.• HDMI Ethernet Channel - The HDMI 2.0 specification adds a data channel to the HDMI connection, enabling high-speed, bi-directional communication. Connected devices that include this feature can send and receive data via 100 Mb/sec Ethernet, making them instantly ready for any IP-based application.• Audio Return Channel - The new specification adds an audio channel that will reduce the number of cables required to deliver audio \"\"upstream\"\" from a TV to an A/V receiver for processing and playback. In cases where a TV features an internal content source, such as a built-in tuner or DVD player, the Audio Return Channel allows the TV to send audio data upstream to the A/V receiver via the HDMI cable, eliminating the need for an extra cable.• 3D Support - The version of the specification defines common 3D formats and resolutions for HDMI-enabled devices, enabling 3D gaming and other 3D video applications.• 4K Resolution Support - The new specification enables HDMI devices to support extremely high HD resolutions, effectively four times the resolution of a 1080p device. Support for 4K allows the HDMI interface to transmit digital content at the same resolution as the state-of-the-art Digital Cinema systems used in many movie theaters.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/tv-out-cable/high-speed-cable/r/h/f/c-e-hdmi-extension-male-to-female-6-feet-3-pack-original-imaeg52wg6etfyhj.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/tv-out-cable/high-speed-cable/r/h/f/c-e-hdmi-extension-male-to-female-6-feet-3-pack-original-imaeg52wg6etfyhj.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/tv-out-cable/high-speed-cable/r/h/f/c-e-hdmi-extension-male-to-female-6-feet-3-pack-original-imaeg52wg6etfyhj.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["ACCEK6Z3GCGRSY2K"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":4197,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":4197,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":3198,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/c-e-tv-out-cable-hdmi-extension-male-female-25-feet-3-pack/p/itmek6z3zgdefarz?pid=ACCEK6Z3GCGRSY2K&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"C&E","inStock":true,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":23,"offers":["5% Cashback on Flipkart Axis Bank Card","20%off on 1st txn with Amex Network Cards T&C","10% Off on BOB Mastercard debit card","₹50 Off on ICICI Mastercard Debit Card","₹100 Off on First Pay Later Transaction"],"categoryPath":"Electronics>Entertainment>Gaming consoles>Accessories>TV-out Cable Accessories","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"Usually Delivered within 4 days.","sellerName":"Sachin Ghai","sellerAverageRating":null,"sellerNoOfRatings":0,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["High Speed Cable","For Xbox","HDMI Interface","Suitable For: Hdtv, Blu Ray, Set Top Box, laptop","7.62 m Cable Length"],"detailedSpecs":["High Speed Cable","For Xbox","HDMI Interface","Suitable For: Hdtv, Blu Ray, Set Top Box, laptop","7.62 m Cable Length"],"specificationList":[{"key":"General Specifications","values":[{"key":"Brand","value":["C&E"]},{"key":"Color","value":["Black"]},{"key":"Cable Length","value":["7.62 m"]},{"key":"Features","value":["Category 2 Certified - High-Speed 18.2 gbps / 340 MHz (Supports up to 240hz Refresh Rates and 48-Bit Deep Color), 1080p Resolution.

Age : Inquisition(for PC)","productDescription":"When all the realms of the land are in deep turmoil and chaos, a hero must rise to save the land from utter destruction. Rated 18 by PEGI, developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts, Dragon Age: Inquisition is a single-player action role-playing game for the PS3 console. This game incorporates both, the Frostbite 3 and the SpeedTree game engine. Dragon Age : Inquisition is the third main release in the Dragon Age franchise. Set in the fantasy world of Thedas, Dragon Age : Inquisition offers greater geographic territory than previous installments. Ensuing from the events that took place in the supplementary novels, Masked Empire and Dragon Age: Asunder, the narrative of Dragon Age : Inquisition witnesses a civil war between a mighty noble faction led by Grand Duke Gaspard and the loyalists of the ruling Empress. At the same time, the Circle of Magi have become villainous. There are four playable classes in-game, they are the following: Human, Elf, Dwarf and Qunari. The combat system has been altered to emphasize more on a player’s position, ability to prepare and form a cooperative team with one’s party members; this requires the player to think and play more intelligently. The romance facet of the game has been enhanced as well. A player’s keeps can be customized for commerce, espionage or military purposes. More influence can be gained by players in certain areas of the world by capturing forts and keeps. Furthermore, two forms of combat systems have been featured in Dragon Age : Inquisition, one being action oriented and the other being more conventional.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/av-media/games/w/y/q/dragon-age-inquisition-original-imadx6zgyq2rkarn.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/av-media/games/w/y/q/dragon-age-inquisition-original-imadx6zgyq2rkarn.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/av-media/games/w/y/q/dragon-age-inquisition-original-imadx6zgyq2rkarn.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["AVMDX6ES8YUZVZYG","AVMDX6FYRGYASNSD","AVMDX6FYGMCMPHHS","AVMDX6ES8VMGTUPT"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":2499,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":2499,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":1490,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/dragon-age-inquisition/p/itmegyzg4srbbhm7?pid=AVMDX6ESVJGQ9WYQ&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":40,"offers":["5% Cashback on Flipkart Axis Bank Card","10% Off on BOB Mastercard debit card","10% Off on ICICI Bank Mastercard Credit Card","₹50 Off on ICICI Bank Mastercard Debit Card"],"categoryPath":"Gaming>PC>Games>Physical Games","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"","sellerName":"Saurav Kanodia","sellerAverageRating":null,"sellerNoOfRatings":0,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["Platform: PC","Genre: RPG","Edition: Standard Edition","Game Modes: Multi-Player, Single-Player"],"detailedSpecs":["Platform: PC","Genre: RPG","Edition: Standard Edition","Game Modes: Multi-Player, Single-Player"],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Title Name","value":["Dragon Age : Inquisition"]},{"key":"Platform","value":["PC"]},{"key":"Edition","value":["Standard Edition"]},{"key":"Type","value":["Full Game"]},{"key":"Genre","value":["RPG"]},{"key":"Game Modes","value":["Multi-Player, Single-Player"]},{"key":"Publisher","value":["Electronic Arts"]}]},{"key":"Ratings","values":[{"key":"PEGI","value":["18"]}]}],"booksInfo":{"language":null,"binding":null,"pages":null,"publisher":"Electronic Arts","year":0,"authors":[]},"lifeStyleInfo":{"sleeve":null,"neck":null,"idealFor":null}}},{"productBaseInfoV1":{"productId":"AVMDGEETENGZ9ZTF","title":"Bioshock: Infinite (Premium Edition)(for PS3)","productDescription":"Bioshock: Infinite Premium Edition includes: A 25 millimeter, resin-cast Handyman board game figurine A Murder of Crows keychain A 5 x 7-inch lithograph print An art book that offers a look at the making of the game’s unique art style.

Synopsis and Features The City of Columbia was built and launched by the American government in the year 1900 as a beacon to symbolize American ingenuity and exceptionalism. Columbia is a floating city that stays suspended in the air with the help of giant blimps and balloons. The city was named in homage to the female personification of the United States and was designed to be a floating Worlds Fair that would travel the world. Later during the game, Columbia undergoes a transformation and reveals itself to be a well-armed battleship capable of raining down deadly attacks, leaving the people below at the city's mercy. The American government disavows the city as they lose control over it. Columbia, then disappeared off the map only to appear to impose its will on the people below. Civil war eventually breaks out in Columbia and different factions are formed. The faction in control of the city are the Founders who are led by Zachary Hale Comstock and they are opposed to any foreigners being given the same privileges as Americans. The other major faction existing during this event is the Vox Populi, who are a bunch of rag-tag resistance fighters, led by Daisy Fitzroy. Vox Populi consists of members from several factions with similar ideologies, that want to free Columbia from the rule of the ultranationalists. After years of war, the members of Vox Populi start using more violent and brutal methods to fight the powers-that-be. The game takes place in 1912 where you assume the character of Booker DeWitt, a disgraced former agent of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency. He is hired by unknown individuals who want a young woman named Elizabeth rescued from the floating city. Elizabeth has been held captive for the last 12 years as the Founders believe that she has the power to end the conflict and restore control of the city back to them. The Vox Populi would rather kill Elizabeth than let her powers be used by the founders. The game also deals with Columbia being ravaged by tears in the fabric of space-time continuum which seem to one of the powers Elizabeth has been given. BioShock Infinite combines some role-playing elements with a first-person shooter experience similar to the first two games. Find and collect weapons to use while you help rescue Elizabeth. Booker is also able to use a variety of powers and abilities with the help of vigors and nostrums that are found throughout Columbia. Nostrums help improve Booker's passive abilities like strength and damage resistance while the vigors grant powers like telekinesis, manipulation of electricity and controlling animals. Team up with Elizabeth and use her powers to enhance your own while you escape the city.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/av-media/games/z/t/f/bioshock-infinite-premium-edition-original-imadhd7nrnu9qgew.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/av-media/games/z/t/f/bioshock-infinite-premium-edition-original-imadhd7nrnu9qgew.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/av-media/games/z/t/f/bioshock-infinite-premium-edition-original-imadhd7nrnu9qgew.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["AVMDGEETZXZJVS7N","AVMDGEETYEYEE52X"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":4999,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":4999,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":4999,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/bioshock-infinite-premium-edition/p/itmegyzh28zcty38?pid=AVMDGEETENGZ9ZTF&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":0,"offers":["10%

The lowdown:< b> This may be the latest in a long line of Railroad Tycoon games but it actually plays very differently from the slow paced turn-based games of old. Everything occurs in real-time as you race to compete one of the preset objectives from around the world and from the 19th century onwards. Starting with a single train depot in the middle of nowhere you have to build up your rail network until you control not just transport but all the industries connected to it. This becomes particularly important when youre playing online against real players as you all compete to service the biggest cities and be first to take advantage of new technology. The premise may sound dull but the game itself will make a trainspotter of anyone. Most exciting moment:< b> As complex as the game may sound what makes it popular with ordinary gamers is that its actually extremely easy to play. Despite the influence you have on cities and factories you only ever actually lay down tracks and stations and the computer handles the rest automatically. It also helps that the graphics are really good for what initially sounds like a dull strategy game. Since you ask:< b> Sid Meier the man behind Civilization pretty much invented the business simulator with the original Railroad Tycoon in 1990. Developer Frixais which Sid help to found is now owned by publisher Take-Two who also own the rights to the Railroad Tycoon name. Oddly the company decided not to reuse it for this revamp. The bottom line:< b> Sid Meier returns to the age of steam with the biggest train set ever made. Product Features< b> Real-time action lay track route the trains and the world comes to life< li>Easy to get started laying track is as easy as clicking and dragging< li>It's all about the trains! over 30 trains to use from the primitive 0-4-0 Planet to the Super powerful 4-6-6-4 Challenger< li>LocoBuilder design your own steam engine from the ground up< li>We've got the goods over 20 different

GP(for PS2)","productDescription":"As motor sports go there are few more thrilling than motorcycling. Formula 1 is fast but the cars look like speedy elephants when compared to the crazily unstable looking shape of a 350 or 500cc motorbike. Take one lightweight death-trap add a loony madman in a leather suit--you the player--and take off around five real-world tracks modelled right down to the last blade of grass. Super! However from the instant the starting flag drops it becomes obvious that this is no standard racer. In the early stages its a swine to control your rider weaving all over the track like a drunk with a major stability problem. Get over these initial difficulties however and what you have is a wonderful game that falls somewhere between an arcade game and simulation without ever straying too far into either camp. Multiple modes are as usual offered for your gaming pleasure including the chance to run the tracks in Arcade mode or go for a full season of racing--impressive when youve only got five tracks. The bikes are fully configurable with settings for a myriad of different components and attributes that should keep the serious bike fan happy for hours. Graphically its a total treat in-game images are good and sharp and theres no slow-down as you hammer around the circuits. Its in the replays that Moto GP really shines; notwithstanding the Gran Turismo playback feature there is nothing more beautiful than this game--at times its easy to forget the TV is displaying a computer-generated image and not straight from Sky TV. Moto GP will not be to everyones taste its initial difficulty level is off-putting but stick with it for a short while and youll be rewarded with a great racing experience and a title thats well worth the asking price Product Features< b> Official licence of the FIM World Motorcycle Championship< li>Real tracks teams and riders< li>Challenge mode--54 challenges with rewards to unlock< li>Season mode offering mid-season transfers< li>Race against the clock your previous best time and the odds< li>Fantastic replay mode that looks almost as good as watching on TV< li>Detailed bike and circuit graphics with genuine trackside scenery< li>< ul>","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/av-media/games/t/v/u/moto-gp-original-imae7ehqypm6yyj9.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/av-media/games/t/v/u/moto-gp-original-imae7ehqypm6yyj9.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/av-media/games/t/v/u/moto-gp-original-imae7ehqypm6yyj9.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["AVMD4ZA8VRZGXTVU"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":799,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":799,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":799,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/moto-gp/p/itmdz2xsdug3yzjk?pid=AVMD4ZA8VRZGXTVU&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":0,"offers":["10% off on ICICI Bank Credit Cards","10% off on Axis Bank Credit Cards","10% off on ICICI Bank Debit Cards","Buy 2 Save 5%, Buy 3 Save 10%","No Cost EMI on Bajaj Finserv EMI Card","10% off on Axis Bank Debit Cards","Flat ₹100 Instant Cashback on Paytm UPI","Flat ₹100 Instant Cashback on Paytm Wallet","₹1250 off on Axis and ICICI Bank Credit Cards","₹4000 off on Axis and ICICI Bank Credit Cards","₹1250 off on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Cards","₹4000 off on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Cards","5% Cashback on Flipkart Axis Bank Card","15% off on first Pay Later Order"],"categoryPath":"Gaming>Games>PS2 Games>PS2 Physical Games","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"","sellerName":"Satvinder Singh","sellerAverageRating":null,"sellerNoOfRatings":0,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["Platform: PS2","Genre: Racing","Edition: Standard Edition","Game Modes: Multi-Player, Single-Player"],"detailedSpecs":["Platform: PS2","Genre: Racing","Edition: Standard Edition","Game Modes: Multi-Player, Single-Player"],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Title Name","value":["Moto GP"]},{"key":"Platform","value":["PS2"]},{"key":"Edition","value":["Standard Edition"]},{"key":"Type","value":["Full Game"]},{"key":"Genre","value":["Racing"]},{"key":"Video Encoding","value":["PAL"]},{"key":"Game Modes","value":["Multi-Player, Single-Player"]},{"key":"Publisher","value":["Namco Bandai Games"]}]},{"key":"Ratings","values":[{"key":"PEGI","value":["3"]}]}],"booksInfo":{"language":null,"binding":null,"pages":null,"publisher":"Namco Bandai Games","year":0,"authors":[]},"lifeStyleInfo":{"sleeve":null,"neck":null,"idealFor":null}}},{"productBaseInfoV1":{"productId":"AVMDAWZFZGCWCEFF","title":"PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale(for PS Vita)","productDescription":"PlayStation stars come out fighting on PS Vita.

Rated 3 by PEGI, developed and published by Konami, Pro Evolution Soccer 2013 is a single-player/multiplayer/online multiplayer sports video game for the PS2 console. This game got a rating of 8.5 out of 10 from IGN and 8 out of 10 from GameSpot. All 20 teams from Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, a Brazilian national league, have been introduced into the PES game series with Pro Evolution Soccer 2013. The UEFA Champions League has been featured in this game as well. Players are given a greater freedom when it comes to ball control. The manner in which players receive and hold the ball has been enhanced. Players have the option to manually control shots so as to get the precision that they require. The pace of dribbling has been reduced so as to make the game more realistic. The R2 control can be used to make the player apply various styles to close control. Signature skills, attributes and tricks of players have been included in Pro Evolution Soccer 2013 to make players more recognizable and lifelike; players can be distinguished on the field with greater ease this way.

Rated 16 by PEGI, developed by Rebellion Oxford and published by 505 Games, Sniper Elite 3 is a single-player/multiplayer tactical shooter video game for the Xbox 360 console. Sniper Elite 3 serves as a prequel to the game Sniper Elite V2 and is the third title in the Sniper Elite game series. Set in North Africa during the Second World War, the plot of Sniper Elite 3 follows Karl Fairburne, an American OSS agent, ordained to perform reconnaissance and to assist the Allied forces with his sharpshooter skills. Along the course of his mission Karl finds out about a secret “wonder weapon” tank which is capable of annihilating the Allied forces. The gameplay of Sniper Elite 3 requires the player to be extremely stealthy when making his or her way through the, now much larger, open environments. The massive surroundings and the non-linear routes give greater freedom to the player when it comes to movement and approach of play. The player needs to scour the maps so as to make and discover opportunities to take out enemies. The revamped A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) system that has been incorporated in this game emphasizes more on tactics and squad roles. More than 40 new distinct customization parts for one’s rifle can be unlocked by participating in the single-player and multiplayer modes and earning sniper ranks. The three kinds of co-op multiplayer modes offered are the following: Overwatch, Story Campaign and the newly introduced Survival mission. Deathmatch, Team Distance King, Distance King and No Cross are among some of the featured competitive multiplayer modes. Another highlight is the X-Ray Kill-Cam which allows the player to see physical features with greater detail; one can even see the muscle layer and circulatory system of an opponent once the latter has been targeted.

The Player goes by the name of 'Lightning Alpha', leader of an elite team of fighters, known as \"Strike Force Lightning.\" Along with two squad mates, Lightning is (usually) aided by local EDF fighting forces in the area, though they are little more than cannon fodder compared to Lightning.The story is separated into 3 chapters, which are divided into separate missions. The first chapter is akin to an introduction to the game, while the second chapter has Strike Force Lightning moving across industrial New Detroit to discover the fates of several downed Landers scattered across the city, as well as their pilots. All but one are salvageable, and it becomes piloted by a Captain Sully, a character that returns in later missions. The third chapter follows the story of Lightning finding and transporting \"The Cube\" to a nest in central New Detroit. Before it is deployed, an Ant Queen emerges from the nest, forcing Lightning to do battle with it to secure the drop zone. Highlights: Over 300 weapons are available. These can be purchased using a new unlock system that partially replaces the in-game weapon drop system of EDF: 2017, though some weapons are only dropped by elite enemies. Four different classes are selectable from the menu, each with special functions and exclusive equipment. All armor colors can be customized. Customized Armors: Trooper Armor: Trooper armor is the standard loadout for EDF soldiers. It has access to more weapons than any other class, and upgradable abilities that allow it to be a versatile, all-around unit. The Trooper Armor is also the only armor available in Survival Mode. Jet Armor: Jet armor is a suit Lightning Alpha can acquire to take the fight to the skies. It uses energy to replenish weapons. The jet pack allows the fastest movement across the map for any class but also the weakest protection. Tactical Armor: Tactical armor fulfills a wide ranging support role, and is the only class that can deploy turrets, mines and radar dishes. Stronger equipment is unlocked as the story progresses. Battle Armor: Battle armor transforms players into a veritable walking tank. Slow moving and hard-hitting, it comes equipped a portable energy shield and can equip some of the most powerful weapons in the game. Battle armor also can release its entire pool of energy in a massive electric blast, damaging everything unfortunate enough to be close by.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/av-media/games/s/s/p/earth-defense-force-insect-armageddon-original-imad22jxgygyahqg.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/av-media/games/s/s/p/earth-defense-force-insect-armageddon-original-imad22jxgygyahqg.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/av-media/games/s/s/p/earth-defense-force-insect-armageddon-original-imad22jxgygyahqg.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["AVMDFW39JKZ79SSP"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":999,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":999,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":999,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/earth-defense-force-insect-armageddon/p/itmdqhhm4gpqfd5u?pid=AVMDFW39JKZ79SSP&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":0,"offers":["10% off on ICICI Bank Credit Cards","10% off on Axis Bank Credit Cards","10% off on ICICI Bank Debit Cards","Buy 2 Save 5%, Buy 3 Save 10%","No Cost EMI on Bajaj Finserv EMI Card","10% off on Axis Bank Debit Cards","Flat ₹100 Instant Cashback on Paytm UPI","Flat ₹100 Instant Cashback on Paytm Wallet","₹1250 off on Axis and ICICI Bank Credit Cards","₹4000 off on Axis and ICICI Bank Credit Cards","₹1250 off on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Cards","₹4000 off on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Cards","5% Cashback on Flipkart Axis Bank Card","15% off on first Pay Later Order"],"categoryPath":"Gaming>Games>PS3 Games>PS3 Physical Games","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"","sellerName":"Satvinder Singh","sellerAverageRating":null,"sellerNoOfRatings":0,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["Platform: PS3","Genre: Action","Edition: Standard Edition","Game Modes: Multi-Player, Single-Player"],"detailedSpecs":["Platform: PS3","Genre: Action","Edition: Standard Edition","Game Modes: Multi-Player, Single-Player"],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Title Name","value":["Earth Defense Force - Insect Armageddon"]},{"key":"Platform","value":["PS3"]},{"key":"Edition","value":["Standard Edition"]},{"key":"Type","value":["Full Game"]},{"key":"Genre","value":["Action"]},{"key":"Game Modes","value":["Multi-Player, Single-Player"]},{"key":"Publisher","value":["D3 Publisher"]}]},{"key":"Ratings","values":[{"key":"PEGI","value":["12"]}]}],"booksInfo":{"language":null,"binding":null,"pages":null,"publisher":"D3 Publisher","year":0,"authors":[]},"lifeStyleInfo":{"sleeve":null,"neck":null,"idealFor":null}}},{"productBaseInfoV1":{"productId":"AVMDFTXJRUG3UVBV","title":"Puss In Boots (Kinect Required)(for Xbox 360)","productDescription":"description This game will be a spin-off based on upcoming film Shrek 2 character, Puss in Boots, as voiced by Antonio Banderas.Puss in the boots is a single player action/adventure game.

A single-player action-adventure game for the 3DS console, The Legend Of Zelda : A Link Between Worlds is the seventeenth installment in the Legend of Zelda game series. Published by Nintendo, this game takes place six generations after the events of A Link to the Past and between the games Link’s Awakening and The Legend of Zelda. Set in the magical kingdoms of Hyrule and Lorule, the game follows a character named Link who has to subdue a villainous wizard named Puga who wishes to resurrect the Demon King Ganon and rule the worlds of Lorule and Hyrule. Having received a PEGI rating of 7, The Legend Of Zelda : A Link Between Worlds sees the player controlling Link. The top-down two-dimensional gameplay of this game is similar to that of various Zelda games. On the 3DS, the upper screen is the main screen, while the lower one shows the gear, map, and items you hold. The land of Hyrule is similar to how it was in A Link to the Past, however, all the dungeons have been changed drastically and new ones have been introduced. When exploring the many dungeons, the game’s 3D effects are showcased and Link has to solve puzzles so he can advance. Items such as arrows, to take down long-range targets; a mallet, to knock down pegs to the ground, and a Fire Rod, to create fire storms, have been included in this game just as they were in A Link to the Past. The ammunition system of the previous games has been replaced by the magic meter which powers Link’s bombs, bow, magic hammer, spin attack and many other items and special abilities. Another highlight of this game is Link’s new skill which allows Link to enter walls and become a drawing. Link can collect hearts and Rupees when on walls, and this provides the currency needed to rent or buy items. Cracks in the walls act as portals between Hyrule and Lorule when Link is a part of the respective wall. Link’s magic meter, however, depletes with time when he traverses between the worlds.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/av-media/games/j/h/n/the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-between-worlds-original-imadu8w6dh8ddkp8.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/av-media/games/j/h/n/the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-between-worlds-original-imadu8w6dh8ddkp8.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/av-media/games/j/h/n/the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-between-worlds-original-imadu8w6dh8ddkp8.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["AVMDU5S5TEUPPJHN"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":3799,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":3799,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":3799,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/legend-zelda-link-between-worlds/p/itmdu5s5teuppjhn?pid=AVMDU5S5TEUPPJHN&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":0,"offers":["10%

Your footsteps are light and virtually silent as you stalk your prey, choosing between the Alien Ceph and the Evil CELL Corporation as you aim your bow and choose your targets carefully. Adjusting the Nanosuit for maximum strength would improve your stability and aim. The latest in the offering by Crytek, Crysis 3 is the third installment in the First-person Shooter for the PS3. The game is published by Electronic Arts and has been Co-developed by Crytek Frankfurt and Crytek UK. The game features a prominent Single player mode with a deep set storyline that has been established since the first installment of the franchise in Crysis. In this game, Prophet reprises his role as the savior of mankind as he goes on a revenge based quest to take down the Evil CELL corporation along with the alien threat. The game uses the latest CryEngine 3 for rendering graphics and game mechanics. Prophet returns to New York City in Crysis 3 after his earlier quest of hunting down other bio-towers set up by the Ceph to eradicate all human life. Returning to the city, he sees that CELL has set up Nanodomes to encase entire cities other than New York. The New York Nanodome has become a veritable urban jungle in literal terms with swamplands, rainforests and overgrown trees. The place has been named Liberty Dome for obvious reasons due to the Statue of Liberty in the vicinity. The demographics of the environment around the city has drastically changed due to the Nanodomes and the associated environmental anomalies that go along with it. The raging rivers, the swaying leaves and the cracks on every rock, these are details that simply cannot be missed in the Crysis 3 game. The game engine used for rendering the details in Crysis and Crysis 3 work on the same principle, however, they differ from each other in terms of version and degree of detailing possible. The CryEngine 3 used for Crysis 3 is far more advanced when compared to the older versions. Crysis used to be the benchmark game that determined the playing capacity of your laptop. The general consensus has always been that, if it can run Crysis then it can support any game. With Crysis 3, that benchmark has been pushed up to a whole new level. Use the all powerful Nanosuit and Battle through the seven treacherous environments within the Dome also known as the Seven Wonders to uncover the deep seeded plot by CELL to take over land and alien technology for their own selfish needs. The game also features a Multiplayer mode that people can play by connecting through a network. Hardcore gamers will love Crysis’ multiplayer mode with assorted weaponry and tactics.

Every path leads back to the place where it all began- Tristram. Seeking to destroy the rumoured evil, you have to rise as a new generation hero who saves Tristram. In Diablo III, you are not just playing to win; you are playing to restore faith in everyone who has lost their belief in good. The third instalment in the Diablo franchise is for hard-core gamers who like to immerse themselves in innovative and addictive gameplay. The action role-playing game DVD is available for the PC platform and has a Mature rating from ESRB. Synopsis and Features Sanctuary is at peace, but not for long. Evil has descended on Earth in a form of a falling star and is ready to wreak havoc on the land of Tristram. The heroes who saved the world are long gone. Now it’s your turn to stand up to your responsibility and try to save Tristram and Sanctuary. Published and developed by Blizzard Entertainment, Diablo III packs in many new and interesting features that were unheard in the earlier instalments. The minimum system requirements for the game to run smoothly on your computer are Windows 7 or Vista, Intel Core 2 Duo or AMD Athlon 64 X2 processor, 2 GB RAM, 12 GB of free space and NVIDIA GeForce 260 or ATI Radeon HD 4870 graphics card. As any role playing game, you have to level up in Diablo III. You progress through the story by completing quests. The new additions in Diablo III are the character specific quests and random adventures. This allows you to indulge in many memorable journeys, thus giving you longer game time. Many small and big improvements have been introduced in the game, including the health orbs that now fall from slayed enemies. Diablo III has 5 main classes. These include Witch Doctor: He can summon undead monsters, The Barbarian: a brute-force fighter, The Wizard: he is a master at combining stealth and magic, The Monk: a specialist in melee based attacks and The Demon Hunter: he can combine different attacks. The game also includes followers. The followers are special as they can wield a weapon, two rings and a special item exclusive only to them. The 3 followers are Kormac the Templar, Eirena the Enchantress and Lyndon the Scoundrel. Diablo III also allows the players to create hard core characters. You will be able to create one after your charecter advances to level 10. As they are a special addition, you cannot resurrect them if they are dead. One of the eagerly awaited and most talked about addition in the game includes the Auction House. The Auction House allows you to buy items by paying real money. This assists you to advance faster through the game. You can also use in-game gold to level-up your character.

They are backward compatible to all previous versions.Main Features:• 1080p Resolution. Audio Return Channel 3D - 3D is the latest rage for both home theater and gaming.• 4K - The 4K resolution is 3840 x 2160 pixels @ 24 Hz.• Deep Color - The Deep Color feature provides a minimum of 8-bits per color element (24-bits total), providing for a total of over 16 million color variations. x.v.Color - x.v.Color High Definition Audio - HDMI supports a full range of high definition audio types, including SA-CD, DVD-Audio, DTS-HD Master Audio, and Dolby TrueHD.Specifications:• Our High Speed HDMI cables with Ethernet have been designed to meet the performance standards set by HDMI 2.0 and have passed stringent Category 2 testing. They are backward compatible to all previous versions.• HDMI Ethernet Channel - The HDMI 2.0 specification adds a data channel to the HDMI connection, enabling high-speed, bi-directional communication. Connected devices that include this feature can send and receive data via 100 Mb/sec Ethernet, making them instantly ready for any IP-based application.• Audio Return Channel - The new specification adds an audio channel that will reduce the number of cables required to deliver audio \"upstream\" from a TV to an A/V receiver for processing and playback. In cases where a TV features an internal content source, such as a built-in tuner or DVD player, the Audio Return Channel allows the TV to send audio data upstream to the A/V receiver via the HDMI cable, eliminating the need for an extra cable.• 3D Support - The version of the specification defines common 3D formats and resolutions for HDMI-enabled devices, enabling 3D gaming and other 3D video applications.• 4K Resolution Support - The new specification enables HDMI devices to support extremely high HD resolutions, effectively four times the resolution of a 1080p device. Support for 4K allows the HDMI interface to transmit digital content at the same resolution as the state-of-the-art Digital Cinema systems used in many movie theaters.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/j3er9u80/tv-out-cable/high-speed-cable/2/a/x/c-e-hdmi-cable-supports-ethernet-3d-and-audio-return-3-feet-5-original-imaejhy9maghynnt.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/j3er9u80/tv-out-cable/high-speed-cable/2/a/x/c-e-hdmi-cable-supports-ethernet-3d-and-audio-return-3-feet-5-original-imaejhy9maghynnt.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/j3er9u80/tv-out-cable/high-speed-cable/2/a/x/c-e-hdmi-cable-supports-ethernet-3d-and-audio-return-3-feet-5-original-imaejhy9maghynnt.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["ACCEHS7YUYX7GWVJ"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":5745,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":5745,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":2497,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/c-e-tv-out-cable-high-speed-hdmi-supports-ethernet-3d-audio-return-20-feet-5-pack/p/itmehs7ymh5gyvzr?pid=ACCEHS7YUYX7GWVJ&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"C&E","inStock":true,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":56,"offers":["Flat INR 5000 Off on ICICI Bank Credit Cards","5% Cashback on Flipkart Axis Bank Card","20%off on 1st txn with Amex Network Cards T&C","10% Off on BOB Mastercard debit card","₹50 Off on ICICI Bank Mastercard Debit Card","₹100 Off on First Pay Later Transaction"],"categoryPath":"Electronics>Entertainment>Gaming consoles>Accessories>TV-out Cable Accessories","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"Usually Delivered within 4 days.","sellerName":"Sachin Ghai","sellerAverageRating":null,"sellerNoOfRatings":0,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["High Speed Cable","For TV","HDMI Interface","Suitable For: Hdtv, Blu Ray, Set Top Box, laptop","6.096 m Cable Length"],"detailedSpecs":["High Speed Cable","For TV","HDMI Interface","Suitable For: Hdtv, Blu Ray, Set Top Box, laptop","6.096 m Cable Length"],"specificationList":[{"key":"General Specifications","values":[{"key":"Brand","value":["C&E"]},{"key":"Color","value":["Black"]},{"key":"Cable Length","value":["6.096 m"]},{"key":"Features","value":["Category 2 Certified - High-Speed 18.2 gbps / 340 MHz (Supports up to 240hz Refresh Rates and 48-Bit Deep Color), 1080p Resolution.

The racing video game is a sequel to the very popular 2010 game called Sonic and Sega All Stars Racing. The game is brought to you by Sega and is available for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The game has a PEGI rating of 7. The racing game is mainly more focused on the fun factor of having familiar characters race against each other on insanely stylized tracks with weapons for offence and defense. The mascot based racing game involves vehicles that resemble kart racers. The characters used in the game are from various other Sega titles that is sure to make things more enjoyable for gamers on the whole. The Sonic & All Star Racing Transformed features new game mechanics like vehicle transformation to suit the terrain. This means that, during the course of the race, if you travel of the road and wish to go over water, the car will transform into a water faring vehicle and the same is true for flying as well. The car transforms into a plane for flight and the race continues in that manner. The Sonic & All Star Racing Transformed is a Single and Multiplayer game with Split Screen capabilities to accommodate two players or more offline. Players can also connect online to play against different people over the internet as well. The PS3 version of the Sonic & All Star Racing Transformed is a well designed game keeping in mind fun and excitement when it comes to the true casual gaming experience. The game features an internal combat system where, within each race itself, players can choose to fire weapons at their opponents in an attempt to disrupt their race progress, or better yet, knock them out of the race. The game also features special modes where players can unlock power ups and skills that can be used to give them an edge over their opponents and win them the race. The vehicles can automatically transform into other forms by driving or flying through what are known as transformation gates, these gates unlock the new modes of the vehicles and are very important in progressing along the levels of the race. For example, if a bridge over a river gets knocked out, then the transformation gates come in handy when you need to convert your car into a jet boat that can easily traverse over the water body and continue the race. Simply charging along a new surface is not enough, for the game mechanics are tweaked such that the physics change for every terrain. The player has to take many things into account before maneuvering the craft in air or water, taking time to consider the physics involved in each medium. The water for example is turbulent and calm depending on the stretch you traverse over, and the level of turbulence allows you to to launch into the air and perform stunts, if the conditions prove right. The game also features something known as the All-Star meter that, when filled up enables you to perform special abilities similar to the previous title. One major change that Sonic & All Star Racing Transformed carries that is not available in the previous title is that players can use the All-Star abilities even in multiplayer mode. The single player adventure mode featured in the game allows you to unlock characters and vehicle upgrades. The multiplayer mode allows you to connect with other players across the globe thanks to the PS Network and helps in making the Sega game, a wholesome experience.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/av-media/games/y/w/k/sonic-all-star-racing-transformed-original-imadc7ybyvk6tzrm.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/av-media/games/y/w/k/sonic-all-star-racing-transformed-original-imadc7ybyvk6tzrm.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/av-media/games/y/w/k/sonic-all-star-racing-transformed-original-imadc7ybyvk6tzrm.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["AVMDCFNZKXFHGAGW","AVMDYFZXWMKKEFSR","AVMDCFEZEGZCXZHB"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":1999,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":1999,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":1790,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/sonic-all-star-racing-transformed/p/itmeh54y6zdmjac2?pid=AVMDCFNZXX4DZYWK&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"","inStock":true,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":10,"offers":["10% off on ICICI Bank Credit Cards","10% off on Axis Bank Credit Cards","10% off on ICICI Bank Debit Cards","10% off on Axis Bank Debit Cards","Flat ₹100 Instant Cashback on Paytm UPI","Flat ₹100 Instant Cashback on Paytm Wallet","₹1250 off on Axis and ICICI Bank Credit Cards","₹4000 off on Axis and ICICI Bank Credit Cards","₹1250 off on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Cards","₹4000 off on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Cards","5% Cashback on Flipkart Axis Bank Card","15% off on first Pay Later Order"],"categoryPath":"Gaming>Games>PS3 Games>PS3 Physical Games","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"Usually Delivered within 4 days.","sellerName":"Saurav Kanodia","sellerAverageRating":null,"sellerNoOfRatings":0,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["Platform: PS3","Genre: Racing","Edition: Standard Edition","Game Modes: Multi-Player, Single-Player"],"detailedSpecs":["Platform: PS3","Genre: Racing","Edition: Standard Edition","Game Modes: Multi-Player, Single-Player"],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Title Name","value":["Sonic & All Star Racing Transformed"]},{"key":"Platform","value":["PS3"]},{"key":"Edition","value":["Standard Edition"]},{"key":"Type","value":["Full Game"]},{"key":"Genre","value":["Racing"]},{"key":"Game Modes","value":["Multi-Player, Single-Player"]},{"key":"Publisher","value":["Sega"]}]},{"key":"Ratings","values":[{"key":"PEGI","value":["7"]}]}],"booksInfo":{"language":null,"binding":null,"pages":null,"publisher":"Sega","year":0,"authors":[]},"lifeStyleInfo":{"sleeve":null,"neck":null,"idealFor":null}}},{"productBaseInfoV1":{"productId":"AVMDCFNZTA5AZCDG","title":"Dark Souls (Game Of The Year Editon) (Prepare to Die Edition)(for Xbox 360)","productDescription":"What will you do if you are pushed into a world that is infested with terrifying creatures? Would you fight them even if you have no hope of surviving the next battle or will you make yourself so strong that nobody can ever defeat you? Dark Souls is dark world that hides the most hideous monsters that you can ever imagine and they all have just one objective - to annihilate you. Do you have the willpower to escape from this cruel world? The spiritual successor to Demon's Souls, Dark Souls tells a fascinating story about survival. This edition of the game is a Prepare to Die Edition and includes new bosses such as Artorias of Abyss and Chimera of Tomb, new areas, weapons, armor and a brand new chapter. The game is targeted towards hard-core and casual gamers who like playing horror games. The open world action role-playing video game DVD is available for the Play Station 3 gaming console and comes with a Mature rating from ESRB. Synopsis and Features In Dark Souls you are introduced to the world named Lordran - a land filled with monsters, undead warriors and many other horrifying creatures. You are hunting down the person named Artorias of Abyss as he is responsible for all the chaos caused in Lordran. Artorias is very powerful and his only objective is to spread darkness as much as he can. With horrendous creatures after your life, can you make everything right in time? Discover the answers by playing Dark Souls. Developed by From Software and published by Namco Bandai Games, Dark Souls tells a dark story that will keep you up all night when you are playing the game. The single-player campaign in the game will take you across the land of Lordran as you try to explore what went wrong in the game’s universe. You have to be extremely careful of the environment around you as death lurks around every corner. The relentless onslaught from enemies keeps the gameplay engaging. There are various types of enemies in the game such as fire demons, lizardmen, evil butchers, alligators shaped like cats, skeletal swordsmen and many others. All these enemies come at you with such strength that you will be dead before you can even bat an eyelid. Only by replaying the levels and with careful planning can you kill them and move towards the next level. You start by first selecting a character then selecting a class to advance through the game. The entire game is like a huge realm with different parts that are spread out throughout the game and only open up after you complete certain objectives. Killing bosses is of utmost importance in the game as you can collect an element called Humanity. This allows you to heal better and plan better as you can take more rest. Bonfires act as checkpoints in the game. These are rarely found and should be searched with expert precision if you are to find one. The visuals are designed to induce fear and they do an excellent job at it. Online Features You can replenish your health by drinking potions available in health flasks and upgrade your inventory by spending souls you collected from downed enemies. The multiplayer experience of Dark Souls is very different from other games. The game is built with difficult challenges that need help from strangers or friends that are playing the game. While playing the game online you can see other players as shadows moving along with you. Fallen comrades are represented as blood spatters on the ground and the final moments in which they were vanquished will play on screen when you touch the blood stain. This is an excellent feature as you can learn the weak points of enemies and beat them to advance further in the game.

Rated 18 by PEGI, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel! is a single-player/multiplayer/co-op first-person shooter/action role-playing game for the PC which is the third installment in the Borderlands game series; this game serves as a prequel to Borderlands 2. The storyline of this high-octane game follows Handsome Jack as he tries to escape the Hyperion moonbase and seize it for himself. The central characters, i.e., Wilhelm \"the Enforcer\", Athena \"the Gladiator\", Claptrap \"the Fragtrap\" and Nisha \"the Lawbringer\", start the game off as Handsome Jack’s henchmen. Though, Jack is initially a good-natured individual, the plot witnesses his dark transformation into a brutal villain who enjoys ripping people’s eyeballs out of their sockets with a spoon. This game tries to explore the idea of how villains might not be as horrible as they seem, that sometimes they do the bad things that they do for good reasons. The innovative gameplay of Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel! fuses first-person shooter elements with mechanics that are typical of role-playing video games, such as, character building, quests and randomly generated items/loot. Another fine touch to the gameplay is the implementation of a collaborative multiplayer campaign. As in previous Borderlands titles, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel! is focuses on four playable characters; these characters were showcased as thugs (NPCs) who worked for Handsome Jack, the main villain of Borderlands 2, in the previous title. The gameplay of this game will be similar to that of Borderlands 2, however, the mechanics have been tweaked to make it much more compelling. Two new kinds of weapons have been added to Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel!, they are - items that have a cryogenic elemental effect which freeze and slow enemies down, and, laser guns.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/av-media/games/r/u/h/borderlands-the-pre-sequel-original-imadzqrrmzzmzh2r.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/av-media/games/r/u/h/borderlands-the-pre-sequel-original-imadzqrrmzzmzh2r.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/av-media/games/r/u/h/borderlands-the-pre-sequel-original-imadzqrrmzzmzh2r.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["AVMDXTZNH58GTAD5","AVMDXUY4WGA7VFME"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":999,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":999,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":999,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/borderlands-pre-sequel/p/itmegyzgnthzguwn?pid=AVMDXH82Y3ADHRUH&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":0,"offers":["10% off on ICICI Bank Credit Cards","10% off on Axis Bank Credit Cards","10% off on ICICI Bank Debit Cards","Buy 2 Save 5%, Buy 3 Save 10%","No Cost EMI on Bajaj Finserv EMI Card","10% off on Axis Bank Debit Cards","Flat ₹100 Instant Cashback on Paytm UPI","Flat ₹100 Instant Cashback on Paytm Wallet","₹1250 off on Axis and ICICI Bank Credit Cards","₹4000 off on Axis and ICICI Bank Credit Cards","₹1250 off on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Cards","₹4000 off on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Cards","5% Cashback on Flipkart Axis Bank Card","15% off on first Pay Later Order"],"categoryPath":"Gaming>PC>Games>Physical Games","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"","sellerName":"Satvinder Singh","sellerAverageRating":null,"sellerNoOfRatings":0,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["Platform: PC","Genre: Action","Edition: Standard Edition","Game Modes: Multi-Player, Single-Player"],"detailedSpecs":["Platform: PC","Genre: Action","Edition: Standard Edition","Game Modes: Multi-Player, Single-Player"],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Title Name","value":["Borderlands : The Pre - Sequel"]},{"key":"Platform","value":["PC"]},{"key":"Edition","value":["Standard Edition"]},{"key":"Type","value":["Full Game"]},{"key":"Genre","value":["Action"]},{"key":"Game Modes","value":["Multi-Player, Single-Player"]},{"key":"Publisher","value":["2K Games"]}]},{"key":"Ratings","values":[{"key":"PEGI","value":["18"]}]}],"booksInfo":{"language":null,"binding":null,"pages":null,"publisher":"2K Games","year":0,"authors":[]},"lifeStyleInfo":{"sleeve":null,"neck":null,"idealFor":null}}},{"productBaseInfoV1":{"productId":"AVMDYFZXWX9PZEZY","title":"Mass Effect Trilogy(for PC)","productDescription":"Mass Effect invites players to take the role of Commander Shepard as they set out on an adventure to save the galaxy from imminent destruction.

The transfer and contract systems have been changed drastically; the changes include more effective application of youth and amateur contracts, loyalty bonuses, the power to lock areas of contract negotiations and an enhanced transfer centre - all these facets help you in maintaining your budgets. Many scouting improvements have been incorporated in this game as well. All the data that you need before a game begins is given to you in the in-game report. The in-game report presents tactics information, squad analysis, information about conceded and scored goals and much more to the user. Other additions include a brand new crowd system, many more stadiums, fresh animations, enhanced weather system and two new camera angles. In your saved game, you can add or remove playable nations whenever you please. Also, you don’t need to play as the country that you picked to represent at the beginning of your game; you can change your nation after a season has been completed with it. The new tone system allows you to talk to your team in a more specific manner; there are 6 different tones that the user can choose to utilize when delivering comments. The newly introduced adaptive layout system displays more information if your screen resolution is high. Furthermore, this intelligent interface features a new tactics screen, customisable columns, filters and many overview screens. Lastly, a new tutorial mode allows novices to pick up the game quick while also offering clues to veteran managers on how to achieve the best they can more effectively.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/av-media/games/h/r/z/football-manager-2012-original-imad7xhxz3mzzymm.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/av-media/games/h/r/z/football-manager-2012-original-imad7xhxz3mzzymm.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/av-media/games/h/r/z/football-manager-2012-original-imad7xhxz3mzzymm.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["AVMD3M6ZUSRBECEE"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":999,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":999,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":999,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/football-manager-2012/p/itmeh54fzhytpq4q?pid=AVMD38SHGGYHBHRZ&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":0,"offers":["10%

The game leads them through the southeastern region of the US -- from Savannah, Georgia through the bayou country, and climaxing in New Orleans' French Quarter. This co-operative action horror FPS takes you and your friends through the cities, swamps and cemeteries of the Deep South, from Savannah to New Orleans across five expansive campaigns. You'll play as one of four new survivors armed with a wide and devastating array of classic and upgraded weapons. In addition to firearms, youll also get a chance to take out some aggression on infected with a variety of carnage-creating melee weapons, from chainsaws to axes and even the deadly frying pan. You'll be putting these weapons to the test against (or playing as in Versus) three horrific and formidable new Special Infected. You'll also encounter five new \"uncommon\" common infected, including the terrifying Mudmen. Important Note: This game is not playable through Steam outside India","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/av-media/games/y/x/d/left-4-dead-2-original-imadagqjuwxazafm.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/av-media/games/y/x/d/left-4-dead-2-original-imadagqjuwxazafm.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/av-media/games/y/x/d/left-4-dead-2-original-imadagqjuwxazafm.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["AVMCSDWCAWMQGUYG"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":699,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":699,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":699,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/left-4-dead-2/p/itmeh542rwmvgdfp?pid=AVMCNZHGZ3ZZNYXD&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":0,"offers":["10% off on ICICI Bank Credit Cards","10% off on Axis Bank Credit Cards","10% off on ICICI Bank Debit Cards","Buy 2 Save 5%, Buy 3 Save 10%","No Cost EMI on Bajaj Finserv EMI Card","10% off on Axis Bank Debit Cards","Flat ₹100 Instant Cashback on Paytm UPI","Flat ₹100 Instant Cashback on Paytm Wallet","₹1250 off on Axis and ICICI Bank Credit Cards","₹4000 off on Axis and ICICI Bank Credit Cards","₹1250 off on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Cards","₹4000 off on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Cards","5% Cashback on Flipkart Axis Bank Card","15% off on first Pay Later Order"],"categoryPath":"Gaming>PC>Games>Physical Games","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"","sellerName":"Satvinder Singh","sellerAverageRating":null,"sellerNoOfRatings":0,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["Platform: PC","Genre: Action","Edition: Standard Edition","Game Modes: Multi-Player, Single-Player"],"detailedSpecs":["Platform: PC","Genre: Action","Edition: Standard Edition","Game Modes: Multi-Player, Single-Player"],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Title Name","value":["Left 4 Dead 2"]},{"key":"Platform","value":["PC"]},{"key":"Edition","value":["Standard Edition"]},{"key":"Type","value":["Full Game"]},{"key":"Genre","value":["Action"]},{"key":"Game Modes","value":["Multi-Player, Single-Player"]},{"key":"Publisher","value":["Valve"]}]},{"key":"Ratings","values":[{"key":"PEGI","value":["18"]}]}],"booksInfo":{"language":null,"binding":null,"pages":null,"publisher":"Valve","year":0,"authors":[]},"lifeStyleInfo":{"sleeve":null,"neck":null,"idealFor":null}}},{"productBaseInfoV1":{"productId":"CGEECC2G3QX9HGZZ","title":"Jurassic Park: The Game(Code in the Box -

The game is a sequel to the highly successful Payday with the original crew comprising of Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains. The object of the game is to go on a crime spree based on contracts. The game follows a 4-player co-op mode where you can play as one of the characters in the team. The game has been developed by 505 Games and consists of a gripping Single Player campaign as well as an engaging Multiplayer mode. The FPS game is designed for the PS3 and has a PEGI rating of 18. The game also comes with a new Crimenet network which is the bad guy equivalent of the police database. Here you will find all the contracts that need to be fulfilled in order to get paid. The team should carry out various kinds of criminal activities like Kidnapping, Emptying Bank Vaults, Cyber Crimes and many more. You can cooperate with a maximum of 4 friends to play the game. A unique feature of the game is that it consists of Dynamic scenarios where no two scenes will play out the same way. The game is a great title to own and add to your collection. Key Features: Rob Banks with Friends – Players must choose their crew carefully, because when the job goes down they will need the right mix of skills on their side. CRIMENET – The dynamic contract database lets gamers pick and choose from available jobs by connecting with local contacts such as Vlad the Ukrainian, shady politician “The Elephant”, and South American drug trafficker Hector, all with their own agenda and best interests in mind. PAYDAY gun play and mechanics on a new level – firing weapons and zip tying civilians never felt so good. Dynamic Scenarios – No heist ever plays out the same way twice. Every single scenario has random geometry or even rare events. Choose Your Skills – As players progress they can invest in any of four special Skill Trees: the Mastermind, the Enforcer, the Ghost and the Technician. Each features a deep customization tree of associated skills and equipment to master, and they can be mixed and matched to create the ultimate heister. More Masks than Ever – PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask system, giving players the ability to craft their own unique mask together with a pattern and a color combination. Weapons and Modifications – A brand new arsenal for the serious heister, covering everything from sniper and assault rifles to compact PDWs and SMGs. Once you’ve settled for a favorite, you can modify it with optics, suppressors, fore grips, reticles, barrels, frames, stocks, all of which will affect the performance of your weapon. There are also purely aesthetic enhancements – why not go for the drug lord look with polished walnut grips for your nine? Play It Your Way – Each job allows for multiple approaches, such as slow and stealthy ambushes, to running in guns blazing. Hit the target any way you want, and watch as the heist unfolds accordingly.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/av-media/games/5/u/p/payday-2-original-imadnv292h7ftrpg.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/av-media/games/5/u/p/payday-2-original-imadnv292h7ftrpg.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/av-media/games/5/u/p/payday-2-original-imadnv292h7ftrpg.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["AVMDNPGBCTS5ZBFS"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":2499,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":2499,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":2249,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/payday-2/p/itmeh542hrhqyrne?pid=AVMDNPGBKQFGH5UP&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":10,"offers":["10% off on ICICI Bank Credit Cards","10% off on Axis Bank Credit Cards","10% off on ICICI Bank Debit Cards","10% off on Axis Bank Debit Cards","Flat ₹100 Instant Cashback on Paytm UPI","Flat ₹100 Instant Cashback on Paytm Wallet","₹1250 off on Axis and ICICI Bank Credit Cards","₹4000 off on Axis and ICICI Bank Credit Cards","₹1250 off on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Cards","₹4000 off on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Cards","5% Cashback on Flipkart Axis Bank Card","15% off on first Pay Later Order"],"categoryPath":"Gaming>Xbox 360>Games>Physical Games","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"","sellerName":"Mukti Mehta","sellerAverageRating":null,"sellerNoOfRatings":0,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["Platform: Xbox 360","Genre: Action","Edition: Standard Edition","Game Modes: Multi-Player, Single-Player"],"detailedSpecs":["Platform: Xbox 360","Genre: Action","Edition: Standard Edition","Game Modes: Multi-Player, Single-Player"],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Title Name","value":["Payday 2"]},{"key":"Platform","value":["Xbox 360"]},{"key":"Edition","value":["Standard Edition"]},{"key":"Type","value":["Full Game"]},{"key":"Genre","value":["Action"]},{"key":"Video Encoding","value":["PAL"]},{"key":"Game Modes","value":["Multi-Player, Single-Player"]},{"key":"Publisher","value":["505 Games"]}]},{"key":"Ratings","values":[{"key":"PEGI","value":["18"]}]}],"booksInfo":{"language":null,"binding":null,"pages":null,"publisher":"505 Games","year":0,"authors":[]},"lifeStyleInfo":{"sleeve":null,"neck":null,"idealFor":null}}},{"productBaseInfoV1":{"productId":"ACCEN8DTVGXBZGDN","title":"C&E  TV-out Cable High Speed HDMI Cable Ethernet 3 Feet Supports 3D and Audio Return 5 Pack(Black, For Xbox, 0.9144 m)","productDescription":"Overview:The HDMI cable is the newest and best digital video connection on the market.

Synopsis and Features Tekken Tag Tournament 2 reinvents the fighting genre with the introduction of a simple yet sturdy tutorial system called Fight Lab. Players who are new to the gaming franchise can take maximum benefit of this tutorial system as it introduces various training exercises. In Fight Lab you, playing as Combot, are a creation of Violet Industries. You are allowed to learn any Tekken character’s combat moves and techniques. As you learn more moves, you can execute difficult fight manoeuvres that will help you to win a match. Developed and published by Namco Bandai Games, Tekken Tag Tournament 2 adds many new fighters to the game. The single-player mode starts with you picking 2 players to fight with. You can switch between players at any time. This gives you the freedom to execute fight manoeuvres that are specific to a character. One of the features that set the game apart from its competitors is the close-quarter combat system. This requires you to be ready at every moment as even a split-second delay can get you to lose the match. The various fight moves include air juggles, combo punch system, blocking and throw breaks. Tag Assault system captures the spotlight as you can kick your opponent in the air and bring in your teammate into the ring by tagging him. This allows you to team together both your players’ moves and execute a powerful attack to reduce your opponent’s health. You can yield maximum bonus for your moves by attacking your opponent in a precise manner. You can do this by using the 3 attack types: launchers, bounds and tags. Launchers allow you to kick your enemy into the air, but you will be dead meat if he blocks you. On the other hand, executing a launch accurately will allow you to attack him with air-strikes, reducing your enemy’s health to a significant aspect. You can follow up a launch with a bound: this move allows you to pull your opponent of mid-air and then throw him to the ground, permitting you to string together a combo of attacks. You can also call in a partner when executing a bound attack by holding the tag button. This allows you to further reduce your opponent’s health to gain victory. Online Features There are more than 50 characters in the game to choose from , but you have to select wisely as each character has their own special set of combat moves. The game offers plenty of multiplayer action as you can challenge your friends or family members in 2-on-2, 1-on-1 or 1-on-2 tag team matches. Team battles have been changed to a Pair Play mode. This mode allows up to 4 players to individually control a character in a ring. Online Features have been updated as you can now challenge the players from across the world. Ranked matches are available that help you in improving your personal ranking. There is also an offline mode that allows you to change your character’s appearance, play in classic arcade mode and do many other things. Several DLCs are available that add new characters to the game.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/av-media/games/e/s/d/tekken-tag-tournament-2-we-are-tekken-edition-original-imadcgy3e2ksyqjk.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/av-media/games/e/s/d/tekken-tag-tournament-2-we-are-tekken-edition-original-imadcgy3e2ksyqjk.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/av-media/games/e/s/d/tekken-tag-tournament-2-we-are-tekken-edition-original-imadcgy3e2ksyqjk.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["AVMDCEY2TJ53MQDK"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":3999,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":3999,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":3999,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/tekken-tag-tournament-2-we-edition/p/itmegyzge7fyushd?pid=AVMDCEY2269DFESD&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":0,"offers":["10%

The settings used in the game are contemporary while the story could very well be in an alternate universe where terrorists have nuclear capabilities due to the capture of several atomic warheads. The Battlefield game is a first person action adventure package that can provide for hours of entertainment. The extensive single player campaign has a deep rooted storyline that will keep you engaged and highly interested for hours to come. You can also jump right into the multiplayer mode if you want to compete with other people around the world. The game has been developed by DICE and published by EA. It runs on the latest Frostbite 2 Game Engine that delivers stunning visuals especially in open world maps where light flaring has been realistically rendered. Shadows, foliage and terrain have all been rendered beautifully along with the characters and weapon detailing can easily be seen. You ideally take command of a variety of key characters in the game, without really sticking to any one person, though the primary protagonist is seen at the beginning of the game undergoing a debriefing. During a major part of the game, you take control of a team of elite United States Marines, experiencing some heart-pounding first person action across maps set in different parts of the globe, like Paris, Tehran, NYC and other scenic places. You can also control vehicles and fighter jets. The game engine truly delivers some stunning visuals in terms of destruction through explosions, game physics during shoot-outs and dynamic audio processing. With all this thrown in to Battlefield 3, you feel more alive as the player, getting a greater degree of game interaction than ever before.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/av-media/games/u/b/z/battlefield-3-standard-edition-original-imadh4c4q2by3bk6.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/av-media/games/u/b/z/battlefield-3-standard-edition-original-imadh4c4q2by3bk6.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/av-media/games/u/b/z/battlefield-3-standard-edition-original-imadh4c4q2by3bk6.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["AVMD3V8E7YB6HSNW","AVMD5ENP4VQRMX4W"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":999,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":999,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":899,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/battlefield-3/p/itmeh54f9smdbzws?pid=AVMD49FTVHSAJUBZ&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":23,"offers":["10%

Pro Evolution Soccer 2010 was developed and published by Konami and was given a score of 8.1 out of 10 from IGN. This single-player/multiplayer football video game for the Wii console received a rating of 3 from PEGI. Also, PES 2010 is the 9th installment in the Pro Evolution Soccer series. Lionel Messi is showcased on the cover of Pro Evolution Soccer 2010. Both defensive and offensive elements are affected by the new game balance system that has been incorporated in Pro Evolution Soccer 2010. Apart from overall stamina, players also have instantaneous stamina now which eliminates unbeatable runs. The player’s control of the ball and body balance will be adversely affected if sprinting is overdone. Certain attacking players can perform different A.I. feints in order to bypass opponents while dribbling. To reduce the space that opposing attackers are given, defenders will now have to think of how to close down on the former. The newly implemented free kick system allows the user to see his or her shooting angle from the kicker’s perspective and targeting is achieved via the use of a pointer system; this allows the user to give more pace and swerve to his or her kicks based on one’s abilities. Neat new animations show players signalling for passes. The Master League and Champions Road modes make a return in this game as in earlier installments.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/av-media/games/9/k/x/pro-evolution-soccer-2010-original-imadqvzfxwcqzhfk.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/av-media/games/9/k/x/pro-evolution-soccer-2010-original-imadqvzfxwcqzhfk.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/av-media/games/9/k/x/pro-evolution-soccer-2010-original-imadqvzfxwcqzhfk.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["AVMCY7SBM82SUX5G","AVMCUJH6JBZSYHJX","AVMCVY54RXFXZGP7","AVMCUTCSHNGUEJFE","AVMD4VZBUEZZRHDD"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":699,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":699,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":699,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/pro-evolution-soccer-2010/p/itmeh543qbunwfg2?pid=AVMD8FFJRGS2Z9KX&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":0,"offers":["10% off on ICICI Bank Credit Cards","10% off on Axis Bank Credit Cards","10% off on ICICI Bank Debit Cards","Buy 2 Save 5%, Buy 3 Save 10%","No Cost EMI on Bajaj Finserv EMI Card","10% off on Axis Bank Debit Cards","Flat ₹100 Instant Cashback on Paytm UPI","Flat ₹100 Instant Cashback on Paytm Wallet","₹1250 off on Axis and ICICI Bank Credit Cards","₹4000 off on Axis and ICICI Bank Credit Cards","₹1250 off on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Cards","₹4000 off on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Cards","5% Cashback on Flipkart Axis Bank Card","15% off on first Pay Later Order"],"categoryPath":"Gaming>Xbox 360>Games>Physical Games","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"","sellerName":"Satvinder Singh","sellerAverageRating":null,"sellerNoOfRatings":0,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["Platform: Xbox 360","Genre: Sports","Edition: Standard Edition","Game Modes: Multi-Player, Single-Player"],"detailedSpecs":["Platform: Xbox 360","Genre: Sports","Edition: Standard Edition","Game Modes: Multi-Player, Single-Player"],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Title Name","value":["Pro Evolution Soccer 2010"]},{"key":"Platform","value":["Xbox 360"]},{"key":"Edition","value":["Standard Edition"]},{"key":"Type","value":["Full Game"]},{"key":"Series","value":["Pro Evolution Soccer"]},{"key":"Genre","value":["Sports"]},{"key":"Video Encoding","value":["PAL"]},{"key":"Game Modes","value":["Multi-Player, Single-Player"]},{"key":"Publisher","value":["Konami"]}]},{"key":"Ratings","values":[{"key":"PEGI","value":["3"]}]}],"booksInfo":{"language":null,"binding":null,"pages":null,"publisher":"Konami","year":0,"authors":[]},"lifeStyleInfo":{"sleeve":null,"neck":null,"idealFor":null}}},{"productBaseInfoV1":{"productId":"AVMEYHZTQZY78BFT","title":"Ultimate Action Triple Pack (Includes 3 Games)(for Xbox 360)","productDescription":"Excitement knows no bounds, now that this adrenalin-pumping action-adventure game combo is out! Explore uncharted territories as you embark on thrilling adventures that require you to battle treacherous forces with an arsenal of weapons to ensure your survival or greater. Published by Square Enix, this game combo of three games (Tomb Raider, Sleeping Dogs and Just Cause 2) for the Xbox 360 console has been given a provisional rating of 18 by PEGI. Tomb Raider: After a destructive storm destroys her ship, a frightened and young Lara Croft is left stranded on an isolated island. Naive and separated from her shipmates, Lara is left with only one mission: survival. Now, Lara must somehow regroup with her friends and battle the lurking threats that the island poses. Play as Lara Croft and discover where her story began with her first adventure. Sleeping Dogs: Set in a fictional version of Hong Kong that is split into four districts, Sleeping Dogs sees the player taking on the role of undercover cop, Wei Shen, who is given the responsibility of infiltrating and bringing down the Sun On Yee, one of the world's most feared criminal organisations. Players get to discover the crowded and glistening streets of Hong Kong as the player-character gets pulled deeper into the vicious underworld. As the plot progresses, the line between right and wrong starts to blur for Wei Shen and his obligations to the police and the underworld toy with his ideas of loyalty and betrayal. Just Cause 2: Set four years after Just Cause, the prequel, on a fictional island-nation called Panau, Just Cause 2 follows Rico Rodriguez as he is thrown by “the Agency” into a nation where the leader, Pandak \"Baby\" Panay,  is a ruthless tyrant and rival gangs are in a state of perpetual war on the streets. Somewhere on the very island lies Rico’s friend and mentor, Tom Sheldon, who has gained top-secret intelligence and gone rogue. The player is required to take on the role of Rico Rodriguez, the Agency's most deadly weapon, and infiltrate the island so as to overthrow the vicious Pandak \"Baby\" Panay and find Sheldon.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/av-media/games/b/f/t/ultimate-stealth-triple-pack-includes-3-games-original-imaefwh6uhb5zbww.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/av-media/games/b/f/t/ultimate-stealth-triple-pack-includes-3-games-original-imaefwh6uhb5zbww.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/av-media/games/b/f/t/ultimate-stealth-triple-pack-includes-3-games-original-imaefwh6uhb5zbww.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["AVMEYHZTHZYNDTYQ"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":1499,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":1499,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":1499,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/ultimate-action-triple-pack-includes-3-games/p/itmeh543zkhrwn8h?pid=AVMEYHZTQZY78BFT&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":0,"offers":["10%

Well, here is your chance to explore that very idea. A single-player/multiplayer sports video game for the Xbox 360 console, FIFA Street 3 was developed by EA Canada and published by EA Sports BIG. Rated 3 by PEGI, FIFA Street 3 features 250 of the finest football players in the world who represent 18 of the best international teams around. Each player has been portrayed as a distinct caricature with heroic abilities. Furthermore, each player comes equipped with an authentic training kit and has a unique style of play. Users can enjoy different types of gameplay by utilizing Enforces, Tricksters, Finishers or Playmakers - players who have been segregated into different categories as they have distinct skill sets. This game incorporates the same engine that was used in NBA Street Homecourt and the A.I. from FIFA 2008. The gameplay of FIFA Street 3 is more arcade-like rather than being a lifelike simulation.

Y(for 3DS)","productDescription":"Pokemon Y is very similar to the X series and also has its origins in the cartoons that were designed for kids. The videogame version of Pokemon characters is equally lovable and so are their trainers. Pokemon Y along with X are the first in the sixth generation Pokemon games to come out with polygonal 3D technology. The game comes with a 7 rating by PEGI and is a standard version of the title. The game has an extensive single player campaign where the protagonists have to go out and capture their individual Pokemon characters that will then need to be trained to fight other Pokemon trained by various other trainers in the same setting. Apart from the story driven single player mode, you also have multiplayer modes where you can fight other players and their Pokemon. The primary goal in the game is hunt down special or rare Pokemon creatures and capture them in the Pokeball. Once the capture has been successfully carried out, you then proceed to train your special allies to do battles with other trained Pokemon. Each win in such a battle allows the creatures to garner points and experience which can then be used to upgrade or evolve them. With the current title, you get to have more interaction with the overworld and the battles are also more dynamic then other titles.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/av-media/games/z/v/n/pokemon-y-original-imadnhhk59huegbm.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/av-media/games/z/v/n/pokemon-y-original-imadnhhk59huegbm.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/av-media/games/z/v/n/pokemon-y-original-imadnhhk59huegbm.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["GAMFNWGZHXHMQBMZ","AVMDNFJGFXGCXZVN"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":3400,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":3400,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":2950,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/pokemon-y/p/itmdnfjxpnz5uumh?pid=AVMDNFJGFXGCXZVN&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":13,"offers":["10%

Even though the United States has military presence all around the world, some missions just cannot be carried out by the book. That is when Sam Fisher and his newly formed Fourth Echelon unit come into play. This clandestine team of operatives must avert disaster and help guide Fisher through the missions with vital information. This version of the Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Blacklist is developed for the personal computer running Microsoft Windows operating system by Ubisoft Toronto and published by Ubisoft. The LEAD engine or Unreal Engine 2.5 as it is unofficially known is used as the platform to run the game. Blacklist can be played in single-player, multiplayer and co-op modes allowing you different gameplay options. This action adventure game involves you using your stealth skills to takeout enemy units without drawing attention to yourself. Synopsis and Features After the events of the last game in the series, President Caldwell officially terminates the corrupt Third Echelon and all its operations around the world. The newly-formed Fourth Echelon is led by Sam Fisher and comprises of elite operatives brought together from different agencies. Their objective is to operate in a mobile environment and travel the world executing clandestine missions authorized the President. A group of rogue countries initiate a terror ultimatum called Blacklist against the U.S of A. The countdown will trigger a deadly series of terrorist attacks on U.S interests and cause mass destruction of both life and property. The President orders Sam and his elite team of operatives to hunt down the terrorists by any means necessary and prevent the Blacklist countdown from reaching zero. Get on the mission with Sam in his tactical suit and goggles to hunt down the members of the Blacklist and use ruthless interrogation methods to extract vital information from captured enemies. Acting above the law and with very little time, Sam has to figure out the clues with the help of his elite tactical team which includes Anna Grim Grimsdottir as technical operations manager, Charlie Cole as the resident hacker and CIA operative Issac Briggs, who brings his expertise with weapons to the table. Travel between exotic locations and US cities to find out who is behind the Blacklist countdown. The Paladin is a re-purposed stealth airliner that allows Sam and his team to be a fully mobile unit. With unlimited resources and cutting edge technology, the Fourth Echelon is the last line of defense against unknown enemies. The Strategic Mission Interface (SMI) keeps Sam and his team informed of terrorist attacks in real time and keeps them updated while they are on the move. Use the SMI to access the money you earn by completing missions and objectives to upgrade your weapons and gear. The new Kill in Motion feature lets Sam strike lethal blows with precision by marking and executing enemy units in a single fluid motion. Use new and upgraded gadgets to get vital information about enemy whereabouts and plan your action accordingly. Use the upgraded snake cam and micro tri-rotor drone to scout ahead in order to mark enemy agents to execute. Use the curved and brutal Karambit knife to kill enemy units in close quarter encounters. The game is yet to be released and the rating is also pending.

They are backward compatible to all previous versions.• HDMI Ethernet Channel - The HDMI 2.0 specification adds a data channel to the HDMI connection, enabling high-speed, bi-directional communication. Connected devices that include this feature can send and receive data via 100 Mb/sec Ethernet, making them instantly ready for any IP-based application.• Audio Return Channel - The new specification adds an audio channel that will reduce the number of cables required to deliver audio \"upstream\" from a TV to an A/V receiver for processing and playback.

 TV-out Cable 30-Feet Supports Ethernet, 3D and Audio Return, 3 Pack(Black, For TV, 9.144 m)","productDescription":"Overview:The HDMI cable is the newest and best digital video connection on the market. HDMI is the only cable that can transfer uncompressed high-definition video and multi channel digital audio in resolutions higher than 1080p. HDMI cables are convenient because they will allow the transfer of digital audio and video in a single cable, permitting a less confusing mess of wires and a cleaner entertainment center. They are backward compatible to all previous versions.Main Features:• 1080p Resolution. Audio Return Channel 3D - 3D is the latest rage for both home theater and gaming.• 4K - The 4K resolution is 3840 x 2160 pixels @ 24 Hz.• Deep Color - The Deep Color feature provides a minimum of 8-bits per color element (24-bits total), providing for a total of over 16 million color variations. x.v.Color - x.v.Color High Definition Audio - HDMI supports a full range of high definition audio types, including SA-CD, DVD-Audio, DTS-HD Master Audio, and Dolby TrueHD.Specifications:• Our High Speed HDMI cables with Ethernet have been designed to meet the performance standards set by HDMI 2.0 and have passed stringent Category 2 testing. They are backward compatible to all previous versions.• HDMI Ethernet Channel - The HDMI 2.0 specification adds a data channel to the HDMI connection, enabling high-speed, bi-directional communication. Connected devices that include this feature can send and receive data via 100 Mb/sec Ethernet, making them instantly ready for any IP-based application.• Audio Return Channel - The new specification adds an audio channel that will reduce the number of cables required to deliver audio \"upstream\" from a TV to an A/V receiver for processing and playback. In cases where a TV features an internal content source, such as a built-in tuner or DVD player, the Audio Return Channel allows the TV to send audio data upstream to the A/V receiver via the HDMI cable, eliminating the need for an extra cable.• 3D Support - The version of the specification defines common 3D formats and resolutions for HDMI-enabled devices, enabling 3D gaming and other 3D video applications.• 4K Resolution Support - The new specification enables HDMI devices to support extremely high HD resolutions, effectively four times the resolution of a 1080p device. Support for 4K allows the HDMI interface to transmit digital content at the same resolution as the state-of-the-art Digital Cinema systems used in many movie theaters.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/j3er9u80/tv-out-cable/high-speed-cable/r/q/x/c-e-15-feet-hdmi-cable-supports-ethernet-3d-and-audio-return-3-original-imaejhxr2qugawer.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/j3er9u80/tv-out-cable/high-speed-cable/r/q/x/c-e-15-feet-hdmi-cable-supports-ethernet-3d-and-audio-return-3-original-imaejhxr2qugawer.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/j3er9u80/tv-out-cable/high-speed-cable/r/q/x/c-e-15-feet-hdmi-cable-supports-ethernet-3d-and-audio-return-3-original-imaejhxr2qugawer.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["ACCEZVBJFSXPM7PZ"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":2259,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":2259,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":2247,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/c-e-tv-out-cable-30-feet-supports-ethernet-3d-audio-return-3-pack/p/itmezvbjmgrjjmyb?pid=ACCEZVBJFSXPM7PZ&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"C&E","inStock":true,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":0,"offers":["5% Cashback on Flipkart Axis Bank Card","20%off on 1st txn with Amex Network Cards T&C","10% Off on BOB Mastercard debit card","₹50 Off on ICICI Mastercard Debit Card","₹100 Off on First Pay Later Transaction"],"categoryPath":"Electronics>Entertainment>Gaming consoles>Accessories>TV-out Cable Accessories","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"Usually Delivered within 4 days.","sellerName":"Sachin Ghai","sellerAverageRating":null,"sellerNoOfRatings":0,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["high speed Cable","For TV","HDMI Interface","Suitable For: Hdtv, Blu Ray, Set Top Box, laptop","9.144 m Cable Length"],"detailedSpecs":["high speed Cable","For TV","HDMI Interface","Suitable For: Hdtv, Blu Ray, Set Top Box, laptop","9.144 m Cable Length"],"specificationList":[{"key":"General Specifications","values":[{"key":"Brand","value":["C&E"]},{"key":"Color","value":["Black"]},{"key":"Cable Length","value":["9.144 m"]},{"key":"Features","value":["Category 2 Certified - High-Speed 18.2 gbps / 340 MHz (Supports up to 240hz Refresh Rates and 48-Bit Deep Color), 1080p Resolution.

PC)","productDescription":"What if you were to encounter a bloodthirsty alien when drifting in space? What would you do? You have to remember one thing - in the depths of space, no one can hear you scream. A single-player first-person survival horror stealth game for the PS4 console, Alien: Isolation has been developed by The Creative Assembly and published by Sega as an extension of the Alien franchise. Set in the year 2137, 15 years after the events that took place in the 1979 film Alien which was directed by Ridley Scott, Alien: Isolation follows Amanda, the daughter of Ellen Ripley (the 1979 film’s protagonist), as she inspects the disappearance of her mother. Having been transferred to the space station Sevastopol, Amanda’s objective is to find and recover the flight recorder of Nostromo, a commercial towing spaceship. Rated 18 by PEGI, the gameplay of Alien: Isolation requires the player to be extremely stealthy in order to survive. A seemingly indestructible extraterrestrial creature, with an advanced artificial intelligence, is aboard the vessel where the player is stranded; its programmed to hunt down the player based on sound, sight and smell. The A.I. of the Alien has been developed to make it adapt as the game progresses, hence the creature gives the illusion that it learns from confrontations between it and the player. The Alien detects and investigates secondary sources of disturbances; for example, if an air lock or a locker is left open then the Alien looks for the person who opened it. The player can crouch and hide behind objects so as to stay out of the Alien’s line of vision; the player can also sneakily peak over or lean around objects to covertly see what the Alien is doing. The player has the ability to run, though this will make the player’s location much more obvious. Furthermore, the player has a motion tracker and a flashlight so that he or she can spot the Alien’s movements. Though the motion tracker helps in roughly isolating the whereabouts of the Alien, the depth of field effect that it creates denies the player the ability to focus on what’s in front of them and on the tracker simultaneously. The non-linear gameplay of Alien: Isolation allows the player to complete challenges in various sequences, thereby giving the game a more open-ended feel. Additionally, players can hack certain computers and devices to trigger in-game actions or access information.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/av-media/games/h/u/v/alien-isolation-original-imadwhfffhknquez.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/av-media/games/h/u/v/alien-isolation-original-imadwhfffhknquez.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/av-media/games/h/u/v/alien-isolation-original-imadwhfffhknquez.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["AVMDUDDXWUNS7THZ","AVMDZ4GZH6EDU9FS","AVMDUDDXHQMZF6HV","AVMDUDDSZGTC79VH"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":999,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":999,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":999,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/alien-isolation/p/itmegyzgzyszzdb5?pid=AVMDUDF8DYN6CHUV&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":0,"offers":["10% off on ICICI Bank Credit Cards","10% off on Axis Bank Credit Cards","10% off on ICICI Bank Debit Cards","Buy 2 Save 5%, Buy 3 Save 10%","No Cost EMI on Bajaj Finserv EMI Card","10% off on Axis Bank Debit Cards","Flat ₹100 Instant Cashback on Paytm UPI","Flat ₹100 Instant Cashback on Paytm Wallet","₹1250 off on Axis and ICICI Bank Credit Cards","₹4000 off on Axis and ICICI Bank Credit Cards","₹1250 off on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Cards","₹4000 off on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Cards","5% Cashback on Flipkart Axis Bank Card","15% off on first Pay Later Order"],"categoryPath":"Gaming>PC>Games>Physical Games","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"","sellerName":"Satvinder Singh","sellerAverageRating":null,"sellerNoOfRatings":0,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["Platform: PC","Genre: Adventure","Edition: Standard Edition","Game Modes: Single-Player"],"detailedSpecs":["Platform: PC","Genre: Adventure","Edition: Standard Edition","Game Modes: Single-Player"],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Title Name","value":["Alien : Isolation"]},{"key":"Platform","value":["PC"]},{"key":"Edition","value":["Standard Edition"]},{"key":"Type","value":["Full Game"]},{"key":"Genre","value":["Adventure"]},{"key":"Game Modes","value":["Single-Player"]},{"key":"Publisher","value":["Sega"]}]},{"key":"Ratings","values":[{"key":"PEGI","value":["18"]}]}],"booksInfo":{"language":null,"binding":null,"pages":null,"publisher":"Sega","year":0,"authors":[]},"lifeStyleInfo":{"sleeve":null,"neck":null,"idealFor":null}}},{"productBaseInfoV1":{"productId":"AVMDXH9DTGRNUKHJ","title":"NBA 2k15(for Xbox One)","productDescription":"It’s time to slam dunk your way to NBA fame in a wholesome game for the entire family: NBA 2K15 for the Xbox One.

Support for 4K allows the HDMI interface to transmit digital content at the same resolution as the state-of-the-art Digital Cinema systems used in many movie theaters.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/j4pwsy80-1/tv-out-cable/high-speed-with-ethernet/4/9/w/c-e-25-feet-hdmi-cable-with-1080p-4k-3d-high-speed-and-ethernet-original-imaekzdyxqzsgcfa.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/j4pwsy80-1/tv-out-cable/high-speed-with-ethernet/4/9/w/c-e-25-feet-hdmi-cable-with-1080p-4k-3d-high-speed-and-ethernet-original-imaekzdyxqzsgcfa.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/j4pwsy80-1/tv-out-cable/high-speed-with-ethernet/4/9/w/c-e-25-feet-hdmi-cable-with-1080p-4k-3d-high-speed-and-ethernet-original-imaekzdyxqzsgcfa.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["ACCEZYRGZEYYHSYB"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":1399,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":1399,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":973,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/c-e-tv-out-cable-25-feet-supports-ethernet-3d-audio-return-ultrahd-ready/p/itmezyrgr4djqyvt?pid=ACCEZYRGZEYYHSYB&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"C&E","inStock":true,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":30,"offers":["Flat INR 5000 Off on ICICI Bank Credit Cards","5% Cashback on Flipkart Axis Bank Card","20%off on 1st txn with Amex Network Cards T&C","10% Off on BOB Mastercard debit card","₹50 Off on ICICI Bank Mastercard Debit Card","₹100 Off on First Pay Later Transaction"],"categoryPath":"Electronics>Entertainment>Gaming consoles>Accessories>TV-out Cable Accessories","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"","sellerName":"Sachin Ghai","sellerAverageRating":null,"sellerNoOfRatings":0,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["high speed Cable","For PlayStation","HDMI Cable Interface","Suitable For: Hdtv, Blu Ray, Set Top Box, laptop","7.62 m Cable Length"],"detailedSpecs":["high speed Cable","For PlayStation","HDMI Cable Interface","Suitable For: Hdtv, Blu Ray, Set Top Box, laptop","7.62 m Cable Length"],"specificationList":[{"key":"General Specifications","values":[{"key":"Brand","value":["C&E"]},{"key":"Color","value":["Black"]},{"key":"Cable Length","value":["7.62 m"]},{"key":"Features","value":["Category 2 Certified - High-Speed 18.2 gbps / 340 MHz (Supports up to 240hz Refresh Rates and 48-Bit Deep Color), 1080p Resolution.

PSP)","productDescription":"Rated 3 by PEGI, developed and published by Konami, Pro Evolution Soccer 2014 is a single-player/multiplayer association football video game for the Xbox 360 console. Pro Evolution Soccer 2014 is one of the latest releases in the PES series. This game functions on a new and modified version of the Fox Engine. The UEFA Europa League, UEFA Champions League and UEFA Super Cup competitions are fully licensed in Pro Evolution Soccer 2014. The sublime control and first touch features set some players apart from the rest. The TrueBall Tech feature allows players to knock or trap the ball during a pass; this can be done by utilizing the analogue stick. A newly introduced M.A.S.S. (Motion Animation Stability System) component imitates the physical contact between players within tailored animations which flow smoothly into each other. M.A.S.S. immediately reacts to every situation instead of a sequence of preset animations being triggered under certain circumstances. This component also takes into consideration factors such as the power and size of players so as to determine the rate at which players recover from stumbles and maintain possession of the ball by blocking opponents. Many new types of tackles have been implemented in Pro Evolution Soccer 2014 as well. Apart from skill and playing styles, players also have mental attributes; this new feature adversely affects players when they are having a bad game. The match atmosphere is more dynamic now because of the implementation of stunning A.I. (artificial intelligence) systems and new sound effects. Another highlight is the new Player ID system which lets users recognize players with great ease due to an accurate recreation of play and running styles. The Combination Play feature can be used to incorporate an array of diverse tactics.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/av-media/games/c/c/5/pro-evolution-soccer-2014-original-imadq2wbz9rfkwee.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/av-media/games/c/c/5/pro-evolution-soccer-2014-original-imadq2wbz9rfkwee.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/av-media/games/c/c/5/pro-evolution-soccer-2014-original-imadq2wbz9rfkwee.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["AVMDMH8DJYY72X7A","AVMDQFZMGXCUVDRH","AVMDZ769TGFSJZGE","AVMDMH8EA5FP3UF6"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":1899,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":1899,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":1899,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/pro-evolution-soccer-2014/p/itmeh54fzntnhjgg?pid=AVMDQFZMYD6RQCC5&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":0,"offers":["10% off on ICICI Bank Credit Cards","10% off on Axis Bank Credit Cards","10% off on ICICI Bank Debit Cards","Buy 2 Save 5%, Buy 3 Save 10%","No Cost EMI on Bajaj Finserv EMI Card","10% off on Axis Bank Debit Cards","Flat ₹100 Instant Cashback on Paytm UPI","Flat ₹100 Instant Cashback on Paytm Wallet","₹1250 off on Axis and ICICI Bank Credit Cards","₹4000 off on Axis and ICICI Bank Credit Cards","₹1250 off on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Cards","₹4000 off on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Cards","5% Cashback on Flipkart Axis Bank Card","15% off on first Pay Later Order"],"categoryPath":"Gaming>PSP>Games>Physical Games","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"","sellerName":"Satvinder Singh","sellerAverageRating":null,"sellerNoOfRatings":0,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["Platform: PSP","Genre: Sports","Edition: Standard Edition","Game Modes: Multi-Player, Co-Op, Single-Player"],"detailedSpecs":["Platform: PSP","Genre: Sports","Edition: Standard Edition","Game Modes: Multi-Player, Co-Op, Single-Player"],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Title Name","value":["Pro Evolution Soccer 2014"]},{"key":"Platform","value":["PSP"]},{"key":"Edition","value":["Standard Edition"]},{"key":"Type","value":["Full Game"]},{"key":"Series","value":["Pro Evolution Soccer"]},{"key":"Genre","value":["Sports"]},{"key":"Game Modes","value":["Multi-Player, Co-Op, Single-Player"]},{"key":"Publisher","value":["Konami"]}]},{"key":"Ratings","values":[{"key":"PEGI","value":["3"]}]}],"booksInfo":{"language":null,"binding":null,"pages":null,"publisher":"Konami","year":0,"authors":[]},"lifeStyleInfo":{"sleeve":null,"neck":null,"idealFor":null}}},{"productBaseInfoV1":{"productId":"GAMEFPWTHHSRCYJE","title":"Bioshock Infinite (Complete Edition)(for Xbox 360)","productDescription":"“Welcome to the city of Columbia. Floating amongst the clouds, cruising far above sea level, this is a place unlike any you've ever seen. Please enjoy your voyage.” And that’s just the gist of the place you're going to encounter. The third installment in the popular Bioshock series, Bioshock Infinite Complete Edition for the PS3 console breaks away from the underwater setting that defined the first two games. Set in 1912, you play Booker DeWitt, a disgraced former private detective, who’s goal is to find a woman named Elizabeth and return her safely. The only problem is she's being held in the flying city. And from that point onwards the game’s intense storytelling unfolds. Oh and fair warning, your trip is not going to be a pleasure cruise. Summary The game is a stunning original world of retro-sci-fi technology and gorgeous scenery. It consists of a cast of memorable characters, great villain and a greater monster, and above all, a story twist that most people won’t see coming. And that’s all that one can divulge. For revealing more will take out the thrill and hours of gameplay this shooter, action-adventure game promises.  Game Modes and Rating This is a single-player game and it has a PEGI 18

Support for 4K allows the HDMI interface to transmit digital content at the same resolution as the state-of-the-art Digital Cinema systems used in many movie theaters.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/tv-out-cable/hdmi-cable-supports-ethernet/y/7/y/c-e-cne522579-high-speed-hdmi-extension-cable-male-female-30-original-imaeh3bz9cpn8ffb.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/tv-out-cable/hdmi-cable-supports-ethernet/y/7/y/c-e-cne522579-high-speed-hdmi-extension-cable-male-female-30-original-imaeh3bz9cpn8ffb.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/tv-out-cable/hdmi-cable-supports-ethernet/y/7/y/c-e-cne522579-high-speed-hdmi-extension-cable-male-female-30-original-imaeh3bz9cpn8ffb.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["ACCEZWD2MEVX2GXE"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":5247,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":5247,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":2397,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/c-e-tv-out-cable-30-feet-male-female-supports-ethernet-3d-audio-return-ultrahd-4k-ready-3-pack/p/itmezwd2tg5rbttb?pid=ACCEZWD2MEVX2GXE&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"C&E","inStock":true,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":54,"offers":["Flat INR 5000 Off on ICICI Bank Credit Cards","5% Cashback on Flipkart Axis Bank Card","20%off on 1st txn with Amex Network Cards T&C","10% Off on BOB Mastercard debit card","₹50 Off on ICICI Bank Mastercard Debit Card","₹100 Off on First Pay Later Transaction"],"categoryPath":"Electronics>Entertainment>Gaming consoles>Accessories>TV-out Cable Accessories","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"Usually Delivered within 4 days.","sellerName":"Sachin Ghai","sellerAverageRating":null,"sellerNoOfRatings":0,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["high speed Cable","For TV","HDMI Cable Interface","Suitable For: Hdtv, Blu Ray, Set Top Box, laptop","9.144 m Cable Length"],"detailedSpecs":["high speed Cable","For TV","HDMI Cable Interface","Suitable For: Hdtv, Blu Ray, Set Top Box, laptop","9.144 m Cable Length"],"specificationList":[{"key":"General Specifications","values":[{"key":"Brand","value":["C&E"]},{"key":"Color","value":["Black"]},{"key":"Cable Length","value":["9.144 m"]},{"key":"Features","value":["Category 2 Certified - High-Speed 18.2 gbps / 340 MHz (Supports up to 240hz Refresh Rates and 48-Bit Deep Color), 1080p Resolution.
