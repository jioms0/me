But they dont have a clue about girls. Or dating. Or clothes. Or parties. Or having fun. Or, basically, life.

The documentary was commissioned by the Chogyal (King) of Sikkim at a time when he felt the sovereignty of Sikkim was under threat from both China and India. Ray's documentary is about the sovereignty of Sikkim. The film was banned by the government of India, when Sikkim merged with India in 1975. In 2000, the copyright of the film was transferred to the Art and Culture Trust of Sikkim. The ban was finally lifted by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) in September 2010. Except a screening for the Chugyal family, the film never got formally released. For many years, the film was considered to be lost and it was thought that the only surviving record of the film is a scene-by-scene written reconstruction of the film by the remaining film team members. However, in January 2003 it was reported that a good quality print has been kept by the British Film Institute. When Kolkata-based Satyajit Ray Society traced a print with the Chogyals family it was found to be damaged beyond repair, finally, a print that had made its way to London was traced and restored by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 2003. A restored version was shown in 2008 during a \"Ray Restrospective\" at the Nantes Three Continents Film Festival in France. After the government overturned the ban, the restored copy reached the Gangtok-based Art and Culture Trust of Sikkim in September 2010, which has earlier received the prints and right for the film in 2000.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/av-media/movies/h/g/f/sikkim-original-imad54r7wf4szmcq.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/av-media/movies/h/g/f/sikkim-original-imad54r7wf4szmcq.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/av-media/movies/h/g/f/sikkim-original-imad54r7wf4szmcq.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["AVMD54MHRZF47HGF"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":499,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":499,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":499,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/sikkim/p/itmd55gjtabhfphy?pid=AVMD54MHRZF47HGF&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":0,"offers":["5% Cashback on Flipkart Axis Bank Card"],"categoryPath":"Movies & TV Show>Movies>DVD","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"","sellerName":"vishal gupta","sellerAverageRating":null,"sellerNoOfRatings":0,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["Genre: Drama"],"detailedSpecs":["Genre: Drama"],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Publisher","value":["Sony DADC"]},{"key":"Title","value":["Sikkim"]},{"key":"Format","value":["DVD"]},{"key":"Language","value":["English"]},{"key":"Year of Release","value":["1971"]},{"key":"Genre","value":["Drama"]}]}],"booksInfo":{"language":"English","binding":null,"pages":null,"publisher":"Sony DADC","year":0,"authors":[]},"lifeStyleInfo":{"sleeve":null,"neck":null,"idealFor":null}}},{"productBaseInfoV1":{"productId":"MIEEPQMPF2HFMU8S","title":"Dear Zindagi(DVD Hindi)","productDescription":"This is the story of Kaira, a budding cinematographer in search of the perfect life.

Among the robbers that include Doug MacRay, James Coughlin, Albert 'Gloansy' Magloan and Desmond Elden, an elaborate bank robbery is planned. One of them falls in love with the bank manager whom they have kept hostage. Whether she will spill the secret out or retain it, forms the rest of the plot in this crime-based thriller. Argo, a drama-based biography that weaves elements of history, is directed by Ben Affleck. The film revolves around an American embassy in Iran that has taken a bunch of Americans as hostage.

Raj had love to share, but craved a family. Karan was the eternal Casanova. Raj was the proverbial one-woman man. Karan had it all, and yet felt empty. Raj had nothing, but his heart was full.They were as different as two persons can be. Yet, bond of friendship brought them together. Their union was unshakable. If Karan gave Raj a home and all the material comforts, Raj gave Karan a shoulder and all the emotional security. If Karan supported Raj at every step, Raj covered up for all of Karan's misdoings. They laughed together, lied together, loved together and fought the odds together- all in the name of friendship.Their blind faith in each other attracted the envy of the world.

These robbers never leave their Charlestown life on their own volition, the neighborhood where there is an unwritten code to protect that lifestyle. Such robbers include friends Doug MacRay, James Coughlin, Albert 'Gloansy' Magloan and Desmond Elden. Doug and James in particular treat each other like family, as the Coughlins have realistically been as such to Doug since Doug's mother ran off and Doug's father, Stephen MacRay, was sent to prison. James' single mother sister, the drugged out Krista Coughlin, and Doug have a casual sexual relationship. The foursome carry out a mostly successful bank robbery, but due to circumstances take the bank manager, Claire Keesey, hostage for a short period before releasing her physically unharmed. They find out that Claire lives in Charlestown, so they want to ensure that she did not see anything that could incriminate them if they were to ever run into her. As such, Doug begins a personal relationship with her to find out what she knows and what she's told the police and the FBI, who have taken charge of the investigation. He learns that she has kept some information from the authorities for her own protection but information that could identify James in particular. But Doug slowly falls for her, as she does for him. Ultimately, Doug dreams about leaving his Charlestown life to be with Claire anywhere but there. But Doug has to try and keep his true identity from her, and keep the fact that he is seeing her from his colleagues. But leaving is not as easy as he would like as he and the gang are tasked with a big job by a local gangster named Fergie whether Doug likes it or not. And Adam Frawley, the FBI's lead investigator, comes into evidence that links the foursome to the bank robbery and a subsequent armored car heist, so is on their tail for evidence that will send them away dead or alive. In Boston's bleak Charlestown, criminals depend on a code of silence; those caught serve their time. Doug MacRay masterminds bank robberies with three friends: the hotheaded Jem, Des, an electrician, and Al, their driver. After a dicey bank job, Doug must make sure the female bank manager, Claire, who lives in Charlestown, doesn't know who they are. He contrives to meet her and then finds her appealing. As the FBI zeroes in on the gang, Doug wants out, Claire doesn't know who he really is, and Jem and their money launderer, an aging florist, insist that Doug do one more job. Are prison and death the only ways out of Charlestown?","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/av-media/movies/t/f/n/the-town-original-imae25kjzb9anhzn.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/av-media/movies/t/f/n/the-town-original-imae25kjzb9anhzn.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/av-media/movies/t/f/n/the-town-original-imae25kjzb9anhzn.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["AVMCUJGKGMQ7UTFN"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":999,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":999,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":999,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/the-town/p/itme44fgycy2y7hz?pid=AVMCUJGKGMQ7UTFN&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"","inStock":true,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":0,"offers":["5% Cashback on Flipkart Axis Bank Card"],"categoryPath":"Movies & TV Show>Movies>Blu-ray","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"Usually Delivered within 7 days.","sellerName":"PRAVIN THAKKAR","sellerAverageRating":null,"sellerNoOfRatings":0,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["Genre: Drama","Main Cast: Ben Affleck,Ben Affleck,Rebecca Hall,Jon Hamm,Jeremy Renner,Blake Lively,Slaine"],"detailedSpecs":["Genre: Drama","Main Cast: Ben Affleck,Ben Affleck,Rebecca Hall,Jon Hamm,Jeremy Renner,Blake Lively,Slaine"],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Publisher","value":["Sony DADC"]},{"key":"Title","value":["The Town"]},{"key":"Format","value":["Blu-ray"]},{"key":"Language","value":["English"]},{"key":"Year of Release","value":["2010"]},{"key":"Genre","value":["Drama"]},{"key":"Main Cast","value":["Ben Affleck,Ben Affleck,Rebecca Hall,Jon Hamm,Jeremy Renner,Blake Lively,Slaine"]}]}],"booksInfo":{"language":"English","binding":null,"pages":null,"publisher":"Sony DADC","year":0,"authors":[]},"lifeStyleInfo":{"sleeve":null,"neck":null,"idealFor":null}}},{"productBaseInfoV1":{"productId":"AVMCNZKQMYJKMEVW","title":"Da Vinci Code(DVD English)","productDescription":"A murder inside the Louvre and clues in Da Vinci paintings lead to the discovery of a religious mystery protected by a secret society for two thousand years -- which could shake the foundations of Christianity","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/av-media/movies/e/v/w/da-vinci-code-original-imadnrvp2kuhs4zz.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/av-media/movies/e/v/w/da-vinci-code-original-imadnrvp2kuhs4zz.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/av-media/movies/e/v/w/da-vinci-code-original-imadnrvp2kuhs4zz.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["AVMCNZKQMYJKMEVW"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":599,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":599,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":295,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/da-vinci-code/p/itmdh9mgh2zxfpun?pid=AVMCNZKQMYJKMEVW&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":50,"offers":["5% Cashback on Flipkart Axis Bank Card"],"categoryPath":"Movies & TV Show>Movies>DVD","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"","sellerName":"VIJITA","sellerAverageRating":null,"sellerNoOfRatings":0,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["Genre: Drama","Main Cast: Tom Hanks,Audrey Tautou,Ian McKellen,Jean Reno,Paul Bettany,Brian Grazer John Calley,Ron Howard"],"detailedSpecs":["Genre: Drama","Main Cast: Tom Hanks,Audrey Tautou,Ian McKellen,Jean Reno,Paul Bettany,Brian Grazer John Calley,Ron Howard"],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Publisher","value":["Sony DADC"]},{"key":"Title","value":["Da Vinci Code"]},{"key":"Format","value":["DVD"]},{"key":"Language","value":["English"]},{"key":"Year of Release","value":["2003"]},{"key":"Genre","value":["Drama"]},{"key":"Main Cast","value":["Tom Hanks,Audrey Tautou,Ian McKellen,Jean Reno,Paul Bettany,Brian Grazer John Calley,Ron Howard"]}]}],"booksInfo":{"language":"English","binding":null,"pages":null,"publisher":"Sony DADC","year":0,"authors":[]},"lifeStyleInfo":{"sleeve":null,"neck":null,"idealFor":null}}},{"productBaseInfoV1":{"productId":"AVMDC3UWGCTWVACZ","title":"Frozen Planet Complete(DVD English)","productDescription":"Continuing their long line of acclaimed series of nature documentaries, including The Blue Planet, Planet Earth and Life, is the 2011 series, Frozen Planet.

Now in his second marriage to his gorgeous young wife, Gloria, Jay has been given something of a second chance. Still, old habits are hard to break, and it's trial by fire as he tries to adapt to life with the same passion and vigor that Gloria exhibits, which are matched by her precocious 12-year-old son, Manny. There are some culture clashes, a few misunderstandings, but also plenty of sweet victories along the way. Jay's grown daughter, Claire, and her husband, Phil, are the proud parents of three kids with whom they want that open, healthy, honest relationship. It's not always easy, especially when you have Haley, a teenage daughter who's growing up a little fast, Alex, a too-smart-for-her-own-good middle daughter and Luke, a scatterbrained boy. Add to this that Phil is just a big kid himself, even if he does always have the best intentions. Claire is the anchor, trying her best to run a tight ship and determined not to let her kids have the rebellious childhood she had. Claire's brother and Jay's grown son, Mitchell, is busy raising an adopted daughter, Lily, with his long term partner, Cameron. Opposites attract in this household, with Cameron having a wonderfully big personality and maybe a flare for the dramatic, while Mitchell is more buttoned-down. They balance each other out, and these doting fathers are relishing their roles as parents developing their own little family.

General Tadamichi Kuribayashi is given command of the forces on the island and sets out to prepare for the imminent attack. General Kuribayashi, however, does not favor the rigid traditional approach recommended by his subordinates, and resentment and resistance fester among his staff. In the lower echelons, a young soldier, Saigo, a poor baker in civilian life, strives with his friends to survive the harsh regime of the Japanese army itself, all the while knowing that a fierce battle looms.

Still dealing with the haunting trauma of losing his loved ones, Ajay manages to make a credible name for himself in investigative journalism. Working with a strange team of RTI activists, ex-criminals and ilk; and even stranger ways of unearthing & presenting truth, Ajay Mehra has earned quite a fan following among the youths, who finds his fearless & unforgiving approach in dealing with all kinds of sociopaths very inspiring.Among his die hard fans are these four teenagers who happened to have received bravery medals from him once. These four friends once out on photography expedition, accidentally record a murder on a camera. The footage turns out to be explosive as it clearly shows two of the city’s most powerful peoples (an industrialist and a minister) involved in the murder of a RTI activist associated with Satyakam. Amidst family pressure they hands over the footage to a corporate lawyer (father of one of them) expecting him to bring the mighty sociopaths to justice. The lawyer instead strikes a deal with the mighty ones.When the kids get to know of this, feel betrayed. Luckily they had a backup copy of that footage with them. Unaware of the fact that they were all now under the scanner of that powerful industrialist’s surveillance army, they call up Ajay Mehra informing him about the murder & their wish to give that footage to him. The surveillance engineers intercept this call and the industrialist unleashes all his power to stop the kids from reaching Ajay Mehra. The minister too gets involved in the preventive attacks by paralyzing Ajay Mehra’s media network through simultaneous raids by various government agencies.Owing to their immense control over the media and government machinery, the evil duo manages to portray Ajay Mehra and the four kids as the enemy of the state on the run- within a span of just few hours. As if it was not enough Ajay Mehra is left to deal with the families of the four kids too, who feel that Ajay has instigated their kids to land up in a dangerous predicament like that. The matters get even worse when the psychological demons of his traumatic past come alive before him, revealing a truth that blows his senses away.

In college, the two made an agreement that if neither of them were married by the time they turned 28, they would marry each other. Three weeks before her 28th birthday, Michael tells her that in four days, he will marry Kimberly Wallace (Cameron Diaz), a 20-year-old University of Chicago student from a wealthy family. Julianne is upset that Michael will marry someone so wrong for him, and someone he has known for such a short period of time. She realizes that she is in love with Michael, and heads to Chicago, intent on sabotaging his wedding. Soon after arriving she meets Kimberly, who asks her to be the maid of honor. This sets off a comical scenario in which Julianne must pretend to be the dutiful maid of honor while secretly scheming ways to prevent the wedding from happening. She engages in petty sabotage - for example, taking Kimberly and Michael to a karaoke bar after discovering that Kimberly is a terrible singer - and later asks her gay friend George Downes (Rupert Everett) to pretend they are engaged, hoping to make Michael jealous.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/av-media/movies/p/d/f/my-best-friend-s-wedding-original-imadhg7fhfgr24ha.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/av-media/movies/p/d/f/my-best-friend-s-wedding-original-imadhg7fhfgr24ha.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/av-media/movies/p/d/f/my-best-friend-s-wedding-original-imadhg7fhfgr24ha.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["AVMCNZKQ8WGNTPDF"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":799,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":799,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":599,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/my-best-friend-s-wedding/p/itmdkznzshzfax7h?pid=AVMCNZKQ8WGNTPDF&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"","inStock":true,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":25,"offers":["5% Cashback on Flipkart Axis Bank Card","20%off on 1st txn with Amex Network Cards T&C","10% Off on BOB Mastercard debit card","₹50 Off on ICICI Mastercard Debit Card","₹100 Off on First Pay Later Transaction"],"categoryPath":"Movies & TV Show>Movies>Blu-ray","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"Usually Delivered within 7 days.","sellerName":"PRAVIN THAKKAR","sellerAverageRating":null,"sellerNoOfRatings":0,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["Genre: Drama"],"detailedSpecs":["Genre: Drama"],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Publisher","value":["Sony DADC"]},{"key":"Title","value":["My Best Friend's Wedding"]},{"key":"Format","value":["Blu-ray"]},{"key":"Language","value":["English"]},{"key":"Year of Release","value":["1997"]},{"key":"Genre","value":["Drama"]}]}],"booksInfo":{"language":"English","binding":null,"pages":null,"publisher":"Sony DADC","year":0,"authors":[]},"lifeStyleInfo":{"sleeve":null,"neck":null,"idealFor":null}}},{"productBaseInfoV1":{"productId":"AVMD4SKUBHCJSGCJ","title":"Swarajyacha Shiledar(DVD Marathi)","productDescription":"Because Of His Close Proximity With King Shivaji, Yasaji Nikam, Could Get Married To Sarsa, The Daughter Of Misaal, The Fort Keeper.

The ghazals of the 19th century genius from one of the purest parts of our cultural heritage. His chaste poetry has lended itself to innumerable compositions and recordings, each one with its own specific interpretation. The Attempts on this serial is to presents Ghalib's ghazals within the context of his life and of his life and of his outlook, both to the people and the conditions around him. In that sense, the ghazals hopefully refelect the spirit of Ghalib and his times in their true essence. The ghazals written by him should flow with his biography.

One of the few entertainments the villagers can afford is the lottery, Malaamal Weekly (Malaamal is Hindi for 'rich'). Lilaram (Paresh Rawal) is the only educated man in the village, and has the job of intermediary between the lottery organisation and the village, for which he receives only a commission whenever a villager wins; thus he has a relatively good but volatile income. One day he reads the winning lottery numbers and realises that one of the tickets has won the top prize of one crore (about $220,000, a relative fortune in rural India). He devises a plan to obtain the winning ticket and present it to the commission as his own. He hosts a dinner (mortgaging his wife's beloved pet goat to the Thakur's wife to pay for it) and invites all the villagers who play the lottery, but the man he is looking for does not turn up. By elimination he deduces that the winner is Anthony(Innocent(actor)), the town drunk, and reasons that he didn't turn up because he knew that he had won the top prize. Hoping to at least extract his commission, he goes to Anthony's house, and finds him dead, the winning ticket clutched in his hand and a happy expression on his face. Lilaram attempts to pry the ticket from Anthony's fingers, but is thwarted by Anthony's body going into rigor mortis. Lilaram eventually succeeds in freeing it with the aid of a knife; at this point Ballu (Om Puri), the local dairy farmer, enters the house and discovers him standing over Anthony's corpse with what appears to be the murder weapon in his hand. Lilaram tells Ballu the truth and convinces him to remain silent in exchange for sharing the lottery winnings between them.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/av-media/movies/p/z/s/malamaal-weekly-original-imaddd7dbzn7gzaf.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/av-media/movies/p/z/s/malamaal-weekly-original-imaddd7dbzn7gzaf.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/av-media/movies/p/z/s/malamaal-weekly-original-imaddd7dbzn7gzaf.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["AVMCPF2YRYZF4PZS"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":128,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":128,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":128,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/malamaal-weekly/p/itmcpf2ypr9gtxtn?pid=AVMCPF2YRYZF4PZS&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"","inStock":true,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":0,"offers":["5% Cashback on Flipkart Axis Bank Card","20%off on 1st txn with Amex Network Cards T&C","10% Off on BOB Mastercard debit card","₹50 Off on ICICI Mastercard Debit Card","₹100 Off on First Pay Later Transaction"],"categoryPath":"Movies & TV Show>Movies>DVD","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"Usually Delivered within 9 days.","sellerName":"AJIT KUMAR SINGH","sellerAverageRating":null,"sellerNoOfRatings":0,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["Genre: Drama","Main Cast: Paresh Rawal ,Om Puri , Ritesh Deshmukh , Reema Sen , Rajpal Yadav , Asrani , Shakti Kapoor , Arbaaz Khan , Innocent , Sudha Chandran , Rasika Joshi , Priyanshi , Sona Nair , Bineesh Kodiyeri , Ravindranath,Priyadarshan"],"detailedSpecs":["Genre: Drama","Main Cast: Paresh Rawal ,Om Puri , Ritesh Deshmukh , Reema Sen , Rajpal Yadav , Asrani , Shakti Kapoor , Arbaaz Khan , Innocent , Sudha Chandran , Rasika Joshi , Priyanshi , Sona Nair , Bineesh Kodiyeri , Ravindranath,Priyadarshan"],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Publisher","value":["Moserbear"]},{"key":"Title","value":["Malamaal Weekly"]},{"key":"Format","value":["DVD"]},{"key":"Language","value":["Hindi"]},{"key":"Year of Release","value":["2006"]},{"key":"Genre","value":["Drama"]},{"key":"Main Cast","value":["Paresh Rawal ,Om Puri , Ritesh Deshmukh , Reema Sen , Rajpal Yadav , Asrani , Shakti Kapoor , Arbaaz Khan , Innocent , Sudha Chandran , Rasika Joshi , Priyanshi , Sona Nair , Bineesh Kodiyeri , Ravindranath,Priyadarshan"]}]}],"booksInfo":{"language":"Hindi","binding":null,"pages":null,"publisher":"Moserbear","year":0,"authors":[]},"lifeStyleInfo":{"sleeve":null,"neck":null,"idealFor":null}}},{"productBaseInfoV1":{"productId":"MIEEHTFGFUJZHTGD","title":"SULTAN(DVD Hindi)","productDescription":"Sultan is a story of Sultan Ali Khan – a local wrestling champion with the world at his feet as he dreams of representing India at the Olympics.It’s a story of Aarfa - a feisty young girl from the same small town as Sultan with her own set of dreams.When the 2 local wrestling legends lock horns, romance blossoms and their dreams and aspirations become intertwined and aligned.However, the path to glory is a rocky one and one must fall several times before one stands victorious – More often than not, this journey can take a lifetime.
