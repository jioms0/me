Akai has designed this LCD television to have a low energy consumption, thus saving you money on your electricity bill over time. Design The Akai L40B30 LCD Full HD Television has a rectangular structure and features a thick border that surrounds this TV. Full HD allows you to watch movies at 1080 p quality on this massive 40 inch (102 cm) screen and not miss a thing.

This engine delivers crystal clear images while also ensuring color quality is maintained. Another technology incorporated in this 40 inch Akai television is the Dynamic Skin Correction with Motion Compensation that helps in skin color correction.

The Akai L40B30 LCD 40 inches Full HD Television is able to reproduce color accurately with 16.7 million display color. The screen has a 6 ms response time and uses the 3D Comb Filter to further enhance the clarity of the image. The Vivid Color Technology enhances the brightness of each individual color which results in sharper and clearer color reproduction. The clarity of the images reproduced is further improved with a dynamic ratio or advanced contrast ratio of 1,000,000:1. The audio quality on the Akai L40B30 LCD 40 inches Full HD Television is powerful and clear with features like Multimode Dynamic Noise Reduction and the 5 Band Graphic Equalizer. The speakers generate 400 W PMPO which is loud enough to fuel a house party with high quality dance tracks. The 3D surround sound carries the sound all around the room to provide surround sound effect while listening to music or watching movie. While gaming, hear every alert and background sound to react faster to constantly changing scenarios. Features and Connectivity The Akai L40B30 LCD Full HD Television allows you to connect various devices to it for seamless connectivity. Connect your external hard disk drive or a pen drive to the only USB port on the TV. This Akai television can read and play movies, music and screen photo images on your big screen from these USB devices.

The lone HDMI port on this Akai 40 inch television lets you connect your Blu-ray disc player, desktop computer or laptop. When connecting a computer the television will serve as the monitor for your computer. You can also play computer games on the television. The HDMI port can also be used to connect high-end gaming consoles like the PlayStation 3, Nintendo Wii and Xbox 360 for an unmatched gaming experience. The Auto Search Feature makes it easier to tune in television channels at the press of a button. The Adjustable Backlight feature ensures that the screen adjusts itself to the ambient light around it to make it comfortable to watch.

From the more common CRT televisions, to expensive Plasma flat screens and LCD displays, you can be sure that almost every house has one. Samsung is just one such brand that constantly strives to improve on the technology and features that they incorporate into the televisions they design and manufacture. Design and Features This flawlessly designed television from Samsung hails from the 4 series of the brand and aims to be your one-stop-shop for all your entertainment needs. Equipped with an LED display, the 32 inch screen features a resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels that can play your favourite Oscar winning movies as well as Emmy winning TV shows in high definition. The HD Ready Samsung UA32EH4000 television is also equipped with Samsung’s patented Wide Colour Enhancer Plus to improve on picture clarity and viewing angle. The advanced picture quality improvement algorithm is used to uncover hidden details and give you a wider and deeper spectrum of colours. In addition, the 32 inch Samsung LED HD television features the Vesa Wall Mount Support that equips you to take the 5.7 kg television off a table or stand and stylishly place it on the wall. This feature, coupled with the classy narrow bezel, undoubtedly adds a touch of sophistication and class to any TV viewing room of yours. The UA32EH4000 television from the 4 series of Samsung is also equipped with Triple Protector technology that prevents the television from being affected by electrical surges, lightning and excess humidity. Video and Audio The Samsung television really does give you a viewing experience that would be very hard to forget. The designers of the 4 series Samsung UA32EH4000 LED 32 inch HD television have equipped it with state-of-the-art picture boosting technologies like a Digital Noise Filter and a 50 Hz Clear Motion Rate. What these features give you is a crystal-clear and undistorted flow of images when viewing fast paced action thrillers or graphics demanding console based games.  Adding to your surreal motion picture experience is the amazing sound field that the Samsung television creates through its 2 built-in Down Firing and Full Range speakers. Featuring the latest sound technology like Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby Pulse and SRS TheatreSound, the entertainment system produces 20 W of total speaker power output RMS to keep you captivated and immersed in the action for hours on end. Connectivity If you often find yourself annoyed by the repeated movies your cable operator and set-top box keeps airing, the video enabled USB 2.0 port that the Samsung 32 inch TV is equipped with enables you to connect and play just the kind of media content you like. Furthermore, the television also features 2 HDMI ports that enable you to connect appliances like an Xbox or Blu-Ray player. Especially if you have a gaming console, the television's Game Mode combined with the HDMI port should have you mesmerized and completely immersed in the video games you play. In addition, there are also a host of other ports to meet just every one of your connectivity requirements. For example, the television includes a Composite Video Input, a Component Video Input, a Digital Audio Output (Optical) and a headphone jack that can be used at nights when you don’t want to wake up the family. Whichever way you look at it the 32 inch LED HD Samsung TV makes for an extremely efficient and value-for-money buy, and is sure to keep you thoroughly entertained through movies, television shows and HD gaming experiences, for many years to
