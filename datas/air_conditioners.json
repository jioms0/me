Moreover, this AC uses the R32 refrigerant, which is eco-friendly and energy-efficient.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/k6pd7680/air-conditioner-new/k/r/q/cs-cu-su24wkyw-2-split-inverter-panasonic-original-imafp3zurchf2z3f.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/k6pd7680/air-conditioner-new/k/r/q/cs-cu-su24wkyw-2-split-inverter-panasonic-original-imafp3zurchf2z3f.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/k6pd7680/air-conditioner-new/k/r/q/cs-cu-su24wkyw-2-split-inverter-panasonic-original-imafp3zurchf2z3f.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["ACNFZYTHXQGZYMMW","ACNFZYTHZGA5GBZS","ACNFU3XZEM7RZH5R","ACNFZYTHURMRCFG4","ACNFZYTHJGTMK8ER","ACNFU3XZCFQHYUWB","ACNGY5TMECAEBCAH","ACNFZYTHUZC2XUDY","ACNGYY4ACUD93G4J","ACNFZYTHXZMHGAAT","ACNFU3XZNZT4YFCF","ACNGY5TMWE7KKYYD","ACNFYZ2YZCMNF9YY","ACNFU3XZ3QCG6WYX","ACNGYY4ACVVZSKCX"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":53000,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":53000,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":49999,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/panasonic-2-ton-3-star-split-twin-cool-inverter-ac-white/p/itm5e6fba98dd7b8?pid=ACNFZYTH2HGEUKRQ&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"Panasonic","inStock":false,"codAvailable":false,"discountPercentage":5,"offers":["10% off on ICICI Bank Credit Cards","10% off on Axis Bank Credit Cards","10% off on ICICI Bank Debit Cards","Get Google Nest Mini","Lenovo Smart Clock Essential","10% off on Axis Bank Debit Cards","Flat ₹100 Instant Cashback on Paytm UPI","Flat ₹100 Instant Cashback on Paytm Wallet","₹1250 off on Axis and ICICI Bank Credit Cards","₹4000 off on Axis and ICICI Bank Credit Cards","₹1250 off on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Cards","₹4000 off on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Cards","5% Cashback on Flipkart Axis Bank Card","15% off on first Pay Later Order","Extra 5% Off on this Product upto ₹500"],"categoryPath":"Electronics>Appliances>Home Appliances>Air Conditioners","attributes":{"size":"","color":"White","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"","sellerName":"SAMVATT ENTERPRISE LLP","sellerAverageRating":null,"sellerNoOfRatings":0,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["Condenser Coil: Copper","Power Consumption: 1264.42 W","Noise level: 43 dB","Refrigerant: R-32","Ambient Temperature: 52 degree C","Wi-Fi Enabled: Yes"],"detailedSpecs":["Condenser Coil: Copper","Power Consumption: 1264.42 W","Noise level: 43 dB","Refrigerant: R-32","Ambient Temperature: 52 degree C","Wi-Fi Enabled: Yes"],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"In The Box","value":["1 Indoor Unit","1 Remote Controller","2 AAA Batteries","Set Installation Plates and Screws","1 Outdoor Unit","Piping Kit","User Manual","Warranty Card"]},{"key":"Brand","value":["Panasonic"]},{"key":"Model Name","value":["CS/CU-SU24WKYW"]},{"key":"Type","value":["Split"]},{"key":"Capacity in Tons","value":["2 Ton"]},{"key":"Star Rating","value":["3 Star BEE Rating"]},{"key":"BEE Rating Year","value":["2020"]},{"key":"Color","value":["White"]},{"key":"Cooling and Heating","value":["No"]},{"key":"Cooling Capacity","value":["6200 W"]},{"key":"Compressor","value":["Twin Rotary"]},{"key":"Dehumidification","value":["Yes"]},{"key":"Remote Control","value":["Yes"]},{"key":"Refrigerant","value":["R-32"]},{"key":"Operating Modes","value":["Auto, Cool, Fan, Dry, Powerful, Sleep"]},{"key":"Condenser Coil","value":["Copper"]}]},{"key":"Dimensions","values":[{"key":"Indoor W x H x D","value":["107 cm x 29 cm x 23.5 cm"]},{"key":"Indoor Unit Weight","value":["11.5 kg"]},{"key":"Outdoor W x H x D","value":["81 cm x 59.3 cm x 30.1 cm"]},{"key":"Outdoor Unit Weight","value":["57 kg"]}]},{"key":"Performance Features","values":[{"key":"ISEER","value":["3.8 W/W"]}]},{"key":"Air Flow & Filter Features","values":[{"key":"Anti-bacteria Filter","value":["Yes"]},{"key":"Dust Filter","value":["Yes"]},{"key":"Other Filter Features","value":["PM 2.5 Filter"]}]},{"key":"Convenience Features","values":[{"key":"Auto Restart","value":["Yes"]},{"key":"Additional Features","value":["Humidity Free Cooling, Dry Mode Dehumidifier, Health Friendly Technology, PM 2.5 Filter, Faster, Quicker Cooling, Anti Corrosion Blue Fin Technology, Shield-Blu 2x Increased Heat Exchanger Life Span, Energy Saving Performance, Twin Cool Inverter"]}]},{"key":"Power Features","values":[{"key":"Power Requirement","value":["AC 100 -
