DSC-H100 Point & Shoot Camera","productDescription":"Advanced Point and Shoot cameras are great for people who are still getting into the hang of photography though still unsure of how to use a DSLR effectively. The Sony DSC H100 is the perfect camera for beginners and intermediates alike. For intermediates, this will work well as a secondary camera or a backup camera. Super Sensor The camera comes equipped with a Super HAD CCD Sensor that has 16.1 effective MPs for high quality and detailed images. This is a great sensor for photography across varying situations that entail different lighting and scene conditions. The inbuilt HAD CCD sensor is highly capable even in low light conditions as long as the hand that clicks the image is steady. The camera also comes with the Intelligent Auto mode that makes shooting images that much more convenient and fun. This mode is also useful for when you need to quickly shoot an image or risk losing out on the moment. Zoom it In As is with most advanced point and shoot cameras, even in the Sony device, magnification is of prime importance right after picture quality. The Sony DSC camera however places Magnification and Picture Quality together by offering a whopping 21 X of Optical Zoom. Optical zoom offers more precision and clarity over digital zoom as it involves actual magnification rather than pixel manipulation as is the case with digital zoom cameras. The Wide Zoom also covers 25 mm to 525 mm. HD Recording You can use the highly capable camera for recording movies and videos at 720 pixels. This HD recording will come in handy for when you want to record your precious memories in video rather than simply taking pictures. The high quality HD recording capability of the camera can also be used to document important corporate events or formal parties as the camera is more than capable of handling the situation. Clear Photo LCD The Clear Photo LCD screen that comes with the Sony DSC H100 camera is a high quality feature that can support 460 thousand dots which translates into a very highly detailed image preview on the camera screen itself. This is handy for photographers as they will be able to quickly gauge the quality of the image before they decide if it needs to be re-shot or not. Apart from helping in preview, it will also come in handy for when you need to decide which image stays and which needs to be deleted.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/camera/y/y/w/sony-dsc-h100-point-shoot-original-imadeydmc9u6z6rt.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/camera/y/y/w/sony-dsc-h100-point-shoot-original-imadeydmc9u6z6rt.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/camera/y/y/w/sony-dsc-h100-point-shoot-original-imadeydmc9u6z6rt.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["CAMDDZQ2JNVKZYYW"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":10990,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":10990,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":10990,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/sony-dsc-h100-point-shoot-camera/p/itm6f55a5bf4652e?pid=CAMDDZQ2JNVKZYYW&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"SONY","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":0,"offers":["10% off on ICICI Bank Credit Cards","10% off on Axis Bank Credit Cards","10% off on ICICI Bank Debit Cards","10% off on Axis Bank Debit Cards","Flat ₹100 Instant Cashback on Paytm UPI","Flat ₹100 Instant Cashback on Paytm Wallet","₹1250 off on Axis and ICICI Bank Credit Cards","₹4000 off on Axis and ICICI Bank Credit Cards","₹1250 off on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Cards","₹4000 off on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Cards","5% Cashback on Flipkart Axis Bank Card","15% off on first Pay Later Order"],"categoryPath":"Electronics>Cameras & Accessories>Cameras>Point and Shoot","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"","sellerName":"Satvinder Singh","sellerAverageRating":null,"sellerNoOfRatings":0,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["Effective Pixels: 16.1 MP","Optical Zoom: 21","Sensor Type: CCD | LCD Size: 3 inch","Max Shutter Speed: 1/1500","Auto Focus"],"detailedSpecs":["Effective Pixels: 16.1 MP","Optical Zoom: 21","Sensor Type: CCD | LCD Size: 3 inch","Max Shutter Speed: 1/1500","Auto Focus"],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Sales Package","value":["AA battery / Shoulder Strap / Lens Cap / Multi USB cable / Instruction Manual"]},{"key":"Model Name","value":["DSC-H100"]},{"key":"Type","value":["Point & Shoot"]},{"key":"Effective Pixel","value":["16.1 MP"]},{"key":"Wifi","value":["Yes"]},{"key":"Optical Zoom","value":["21"]},{"key":"Maximum Shutter Speed","value":["1/1500 sec"]}]},{"key":"Sensor and Sensitivity Features","values":[{"key":"Sensor Type","value":["CCD"]},{"key":"Sensor Size","value":["1/2.3"]},{"key":"ISO Rating","value":["Auto ISO 80 -

This makes the entry-level AX500 a perfect choice for those looking to start from the very basics in digital photography. This Fujifilm point and shoot digital camera features a Fujinon lens with a focal length of 5.9 - 29.5mm or 35 mm equivalent of 33 – 165 mm. Featuring a 5x optical zoom and an additional 6.7x of digital zoom, the AX500 is capable of considerable levels of overall magnification. The advent of a very capable CCD image sensor with a primary colour filter gives this digital camera a brilliant resolution of 14 megapixels. With a total weight of 168 g which includes the batteries and the memory card, this Fujifilm camera becomes increasingly portable and easy to carry around, even in the comfort of your pocket. The 14 megapixel resolution along with the CCD image sensor gives this camera the ability to record HD videos with 1280 x 720 resolution at 30 fps with monaural sound capture with both PAL and NTSC output options. These high resolution images and videos can be viewed on the FinePix AX500’s 2.7 inch colour display that boasts a display resolution of 230,000 dots. This LCD colour display also doubles as a live viewfinder as this Fujifilm camera does not come with an optical viewfinder. Battery and Storage This Fujifilm FinePix is powered either by 2 AA alkaline batteries or 2 AA Ni-MH (Nickel-metal hydride) batteries as an alternative. In the auto mode the AA alkaline batteries can power the AX500 for up to 180 shots while the Ni-MH batteries can last for up to an amazing 480 shots. All the captured images and the recorded videos are saved on the AX500’s memory medium which is in the form of an SD or an SDHC memory card. The transfer of saved files from the camera’s memory device to a PC or a laptop is done via its high-speed USB 2.0 digital interface. Performance The aperture control lets you adjust the amount of light that is allowed to fall on the image sensor, which in this Fujifilm camera ranges from f/3.3 to f/5.9. It also features an autofocus function with a range that spans from 45 cm (Wide) and 80 cm (Tele) to infinity. It also has a macro focus range of 10 cm - 80 cm on wide and 60 cm - 1 m on tele. The light sensitivity of this camera ranges from ISO 100 to 3200, giving you clear images irrespective of the available lighting conditions. The AX500 also features a wide range of adjustable shutter speeds that range from a maximum 1/1400 sec to a minimum of 8 sec. A built-in flash with auto and manual adjustment modes lets you control the intensity of the flash, with a range of 60 cm to 3 m (Wide) and 60 cm to 2 m (Tele). This when clubbed with Red Eye Reduction makes it possible to capture clear and sharp images even under low light. Features The intelligent auto scene mode identifies the scene you're shooting, be it portrait, landscape, night portrait, macro, or sport and automatically adjusts the camera's settings for optimum results. With 6 pre-set white balancing options to choose from, the AX500 lets you choose from a variety of image tone and temperature settings. This FinePix also sports a digital image stabilizer that makes sure that the captured images and videos are sharp and blur free. The AX500 also comes with face detection that automatically detects human faces within the frame, so that maximum priority is given to the clarity of the faces rather than other elements. The PictBridge technology lets you connect the camera directly to a printer without a PC, enabling easy and direct photo printing. The self-timer mode lets you delay the shutter release by 2 or 10 seconds, making this a very convenient option for self-portraits and group shots. The continuous mode lets the FinePix AX500 shoot at a maximum speed of 1.2 frames per second.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/camera/a/k/w/fujifilm-ax500-original-imadb7ahnbbqbazj.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/camera/a/k/w/fujifilm-ax500-original-imadb7ahnbbqbazj.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/camera/a/k/w/fujifilm-ax500-original-imadb7ahnbbqbazj.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["CAMDDTS3PGBMTW5J","CAMD8QV8YKYNVFUH","CAMD9XW3DKA9AZMH","CAMD9XW3ZYZA3EK9"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":5499,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":5499,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":5499,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/fujifilm-ax500-point-shoot-camera/p/itm86ea6a09eb2bf?pid=CAMD9XW3PBP8TAKW&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"FUJIFILM","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":0,"offers":["10% off on ICICI Bank Credit Cards","10% off on Axis Bank Credit Cards","10% off on ICICI Bank Debit Cards","10% off on Axis Bank Debit Cards","Flat ₹100 Instant Cashback on Paytm UPI","Flat ₹100 Instant Cashback on Paytm Wallet","₹1250 off on Axis and ICICI Bank Credit Cards","₹4000 off on Axis and ICICI Bank Credit Cards","₹1250 off on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Cards","₹4000 off on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Cards","5% Cashback on Flipkart Axis Bank Card","15% off on first Pay Later Order"],"categoryPath":"Electronics>Cameras & Accessories>Cameras>Point and Shoot","attributes":{"size":"","color":"Red","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"","sellerName":"Satvinder Singh","sellerAverageRating":null,"sellerNoOfRatings":0,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["Effective Pixels: 14 MP","Optical Zoom: 5 | Digital Zoom: 6.7x","Sensor Type: CCD | LCD Size: 2.7 inch","Max Shutter Speed: 1/1400","Auto Focus"],"detailedSpecs":["Effective Pixels: 14 MP","Optical Zoom: 5 | Digital Zoom: 6.7x","Sensor Type: CCD | LCD Size: 2.7 inch","Max Shutter Speed: 1/1400","Auto Focus"],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Sales Package","value":["Hand Strap, Owner's Manual, USB Cable, CD-ROM"]},{"key":"Model Name","value":["AX500"]},{"key":"Series","value":["FinePix"]},{"key":"Type","value":["Point & Shoot"]},{"key":"Effective Pixel","value":["14 MP"]},{"key":"Optical Zoom","value":["5"]},{"key":"Maximum Shutter Speed","value":["1/1400 sec"]}]},{"key":"Sensor and Sensitivity Features","values":[{"key":"Sensor Type","value":["CCD"]},{"key":"Sensor Size","value":["1/2.3"]},{"key":"ISO Rating","value":["ISO 100 - 3200 (Auto)"]},{"key":"Metering","value":["TTL 256 Zones Metering"]}]},{"key":"Focus Features","values":[{"key":"Auto Focus","value":["Yes"]},{"key":"Digital Zoom","value":["6.7x"]}]},{"key":"Lens & Exposure Features","values":[{"key":"Type of Lens","value":["Fujinon"]},{"key":"Lens Color Filter","value":["Primary (RGB) Color Filter"]},{"key":"Lens Focal Length","value":["5.9 - 29.5 mm (35 mm Equivalent to 33 - 165 mm)"]},{"key":"Aperture Range","value":["F3.3 (W) - F5.9 (T)"]},{"key":"Minimum Shutter Speed","value":["8 sec"]}]},{"key":"Modes and Functions","values":[{"key":"Built-in Flash","value":["Yes"]},{"key":"Flash Modes","value":["Red-eye Removal Off: Auto, Forced Flash, Suppressed Flash, Slow Sync, Red-eye Removal On: Red-eye Reduction Auto, Red-eye Reduction and Forced Flash, Suppressed Flash, Red-eye Reduction with Slow Sync"]},{"key":"Flash Range","value":["60 cm - 3.0 m (W), 60 cm - 2.0 m (T)"]},{"key":"HD Support","value":["Yes"]},{"key":"Delete Function","value":["Yes"]},{"key":"Self-timer","value":["Yes"]},{"key":"Red Eye Reduction","value":["Yes"]},{"key":"Macro Mode","value":["Yes, 10 cm - 80 cm (W), 60 cm - 1.0 m (T)"]},{"key":"Other Features","value":["Lens Construction: 8 Elements in 8 Groups, Programmed AE Exposure Mode, Scene Mode: Portrait, Baby, Smile and Shoot, Landscape, Motion Panorama, Sport, Night, Night (Tripod), Fireworks, Sunset, Snow, Beach, Party, Flower, Text, 2 EV in increments of 1/3 EV Exposure Compensation, (Auto Mode) TBD Shutter Speed, Focus Mode: Single AF, Continuous AF (SR AUTO, Movie), AF Frame Selection: Center / Tracking, Auto Flash (i-flash), Photography Functions: SR Auto, Face Detection, Auto Red-eye Removal, Blink Detection, Framing Guideline, Automatic LCD Brightness Adjustment, Frame Number Memory, Playback Functions: Face Detection, Photobook Assist, Image Search, Erase Selected Frames, Slide Show, Auto Red-eye Removal, Protect, Crop, Resize, Image rotate, Mark for Upload, Multi-frame Playback (with Microthumbnail), Panorama, Favorite, Other Functions: PictBridge, Exif Print, Time Difference, Discharge Option for Rechargeable Ni-MH Batteries, Silent Mode, 0 - 40&deg;

The Nikon Coolpix L26 is a handy camera that belongs to the Life series of point and shoot digital cameras from Nikon. The L26 is easy to use and is ideal for those who are new to the hobby of photography. The Coolpix L26 features a focal length of 4.6 - 23 mm, with a 35 mm equivalent focal length of 26 - 130 mm. The camera sports an optical zoom of 5x and digital zoom of 4x. The CCD image sensor of the Nikon L26 lets you take pictures at a 16.1 megapixel resolution. The compact Nikon L26 is designed for an increased level of comfort. The L26 weighs 164 g and can be slipped into your pocket and easily carried around, even in crowds or when you’re in a hurry. The buttons are all grouped closely on the back panel, making menu changes easy even when you’re in the middle of taking a photograph. You can record every moment of your precious memories in high definition video quality. The HD video mode captures footage at 1280 x 720 dot pixel resolution and 30 fps. The EXPEED C2 image processor lets you take high quality photographs with minimum noise (grains). The 3 inch TFT LCD screen enables you to preview and compose your images every time, ensuring that your photographs reflect your memories perfectly. Battery and Storage Photographs taken with this Nikon point and shoot camera are stored in SD, SDHC and SDXC memory cards. For further space, you can transfer images from the camera to a computer or PC using the high speed USB port of the Coolpix L26. This Nikon camera is powered by 2 AA size alkaline batteries that let you take up to 200 images on full charge. You can alternately use 2 Lithium Ion or rechargeable NiMh batteries and take up to 680 or 350 shots respectively, on full charge. Performance The Nikon Coolpix L26 has an aperture range of f/3.2 - 6.5, which is the measure of the lens opening that controls the amount of light falling on the image sensor of the camera. The Auto Focus feature of the camera lets you focus in the range of 50 cm to infinity (Wide) and 80 cm onwards (Tele). The camera sports a light sensitivity range of ISO 80 - 1600, which indicates that the camera is acutely sensitive to light and can take images in most light conditions. The Coolpix L26 has a shutter speed range of 1/2000 - 1 sec, which can be reduced to 4 seconds in Fireworks Show mode. This lets you take spectacular images of lights in the dark. The built-in flash of this Nikon digital camera has a functioning range of 0.5 - 3.6 m (Wide) and 0.8 - 1.7 m (Tele), lighting up your subject dramatically for clear and sharp images, whether at dawn or dusk. Features Pictures taken in standard and popular settings will now be more breathtaking, with the 21 shooting modes available in this camera. These include Food, Museum, Panorama, Snow mode and more. In Food mode, the settings are optimized to make food look healthier and juicier, enhancing your photographs immeasurably. The electronic Vibration Reduction feature ensures that your pictures are stable and blur-free. The Face Detection feature detects faces in the frame and ensures that the focus and exposure settings are optimum to catch them in sharp relief. The Smile Timer function captures a shot the instant it recognizes a smiling subject in the frame. In Blink Proof mode, the Coolpix L26 lets you know when a subject has blinked, letting you take another image to replace the earlier one. The self-timer of this Nikon digital point and shoot camera lets you delay shutter release by 10 seconds, so that you never have to miss out on being in a picture with your friends and family ever again. With the Continuous Shooting mode, you can take up to 4 images at 1.2 frames per second, and record long sequences in action for quirky and memorable photographs.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/camera/f/5/w/nikon-coolpix-l26-point-shoot-original-imad7fzrhj3mur76.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/camera/f/5/w/nikon-coolpix-l26-point-shoot-original-imad7fzrhj3mur76.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/camera/f/5/w/nikon-coolpix-l26-point-shoot-original-imad7fzrhj3mur76.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["CAMD72H4TJTYXFEA","CAMD72H4P36FPGRX","CAMD72H4TG27KW54"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":5450,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":5450,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":5450,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/nikon-l26-point-shoot-camera/p/itm8069103513318?pid=CAMD7FNWYQNGXF5W&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"NIKON","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":0,"offers":["10% off on ICICI Bank Credit Cards","10% off on Axis Bank Credit Cards","10% off on ICICI Bank Debit Cards","10% off on Axis Bank Debit Cards","Flat ₹100 Instant Cashback on Paytm UPI","Flat ₹100 Instant Cashback on Paytm Wallet","₹1250 off on Axis and ICICI Bank Credit Cards","₹4000 off on Axis and ICICI Bank Credit Cards","₹1250 off on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Cards","₹4000 off on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Cards","5% Cashback on Flipkart Axis Bank Card","15% off on first Pay Later Order"],"categoryPath":"Electronics>Cameras & Accessories>Cameras>Point and Shoot","attributes":{"size":"","color":"Black","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"","sellerName":"Satvinder Singh","sellerAverageRating":null,"sellerNoOfRatings":0,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["Effective Pixels: 16.1 MP","Optical Zoom: 5 | Digital Zoom: 4x","Sensor Type: CCD | LCD Size: 3 inch","Auto Focus"],"detailedSpecs":["Effective Pixels: 16.1 MP","Optical Zoom: 5 | Digital Zoom: 4x","Sensor Type: CCD | LCD Size: 3 inch","Auto Focus"],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Sales Package","value":["ViewNX 2 Installer CD, USB Cable UC-E16, 4 GB card, Camera Case, AA battery, LR6/L40 (AA-size) Alkaline Batteries (x2), Camera Strap, Reference Manual CD, Battery Charger"]},{"key":"Model Name","value":["L26"]},{"key":"Series","value":["Coolpix"]},{"key":"Type","value":["Point & Shoot"]},{"key":"Effective Pixel","value":["16.1 MP"]},{"key":"Optical Zoom","value":["5"]}]},{"key":"Sensor and Sensitivity Features","values":[{"key":"Sensor Type","value":["CCD"]},{"key":"Sensor Size","value":["1/2.3"]},{"key":"ISO Rating","value":["ISO 80 -

The CCD image sensor that the camera uses is also capable of high quality images without the need to constantly change the ISO settings according to the lighting conditions. Nikkor Inside Most cameras by Nikon are built around the lens, thereby giving the lens prime importance when designing a whole camera around it.

It comes equipped with a highly capable 16 MP low light capable CMOS Sensor that can function beautifully at a wide range of lighting conditions. Zoom in Close Being an advanced point and shoot device, it comes equipped with a highly capable Nikkor ED Lens. This lens is made with high precision and comes with an optical zoom level of 30 X. This is a great range of zoom as it allows you to use the optics and not the sensor and receptor to get a magnification. The optical zoom allows for light focusing whereas the digital zoom involves simple magnification of the pixels, which result in pixilated images. Display Monitor Technology This camera is equipped with a high quality 3 inch VGA LCD display that lets you preview your captured images. This helps you decide if more shots are required or if you can simply move onto the next subject. The LCD screen also lets you view and compose the image before you actually shoot it, much like the viewfinder of the camera. Full HD Recording This camera is equipped with the ability to take high quality crystal clear HD videos at a resolution of 1080 pixels. The exceptional video and picture quality can be seen when the camera is connected to an HD TV. The camera is also equipped with a microphone that can record stereo sound. This is important when having high quality videos. Other Features The camera is equipped with the Lens-shift Vibration Reduction feature for high image quality. This allows for precise and life-like images thanks to the EXPEED C2 image-processing engine. It is also easier to carry around thanks to the larger ergonomic design that lets you handle it easily.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/camera/g/y/c/nikon-coolpix-l820-advance-point-and-shoot-original-imadhwh6xuntr5vd.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/camera/g/y/c/nikon-coolpix-l820-advance-point-and-shoot-original-imadhwh6xuntr5vd.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/camera/g/y/c/nikon-coolpix-l820-advance-point-and-shoot-original-imadhwh6xuntr5vd.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["CAMDGA2HRMH6R7YZ","CAMDGA2HSHZPRRPQ","CAMDGA2HAFXRVQVX"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":15450,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":15450,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":15450,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/nikon-l820-advanced-point-shoot-camera/p/itm89d77beb19beb?pid=CAMDHWH7VGA8KGYC&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"NIKON","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":0,"offers":["10%

The Nikon camera can also augment the pictures with a host of special effects that can be configured on it through the special effects mode. Some of these effects can be, Selective Color, Color Sketch and also the Miniature Effect. High Speed Shooting When you come across that perfect shot, there are instances where you know instinctively that one picture just won’t cut it. Use the camera’s High Speed Continuous Shooting mode to capture the whole series of events in high quality details. Silent Shutter This camera by Nikon is also equipped with a revolutionary new Silent Shutter mechanism that greatly reduces the sound made by the mechanical shutter commonly used by DSLR cameras. The lack of loud sounds associated with the shutter release will allow for better photography thanks to less distractions and miniscule vibrations caused by the excess noise, as sound after all, is derived from vibrations. Sensor Technology This Nikon camera is equipped with a high quality DX format CMOS image processing Sensor that is capable of taking high quality images thanks to the camera’s excellent lenses. The CMOS image sensor is also more advanced than previous forms of sensors used by Nikon as it allows for greater details and colour reproductions.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/camera/m/h/s/nikon-d5100-dslr-original-imaeyxfaff3ptqh4.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/camera/m/h/s/nikon-d5100-dslr-original-imaeyxfaff3ptqh4.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/camera/m/h/s/nikon-d5100-dslr-original-imaeyxfaff3ptqh4.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["CAMDTAKFRNY9PVXE","CAMDTAKFK3UHXRHM","CAMDVZYHQSBB3ZHE","CAMCY858EZGFM2ET"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":30950,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":30950,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":30950,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/nikon-d5100-dslr-camera/p/itm70d4421be250c?pid=CAMCXH4FFUDGAMHS&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"NIKON","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":0,"offers":["10% off on ICICI Bank Credit Cards","10% off on Axis Bank Credit Cards","10% off on ICICI Bank Debit Cards","No Cost EMI on Bajaj Finserv EMI Card","10% off on Axis Bank Debit Cards","Flat ₹100 Instant Cashback on Paytm UPI","Flat ₹100 Instant Cashback on Paytm Wallet","₹1250 off on Axis and ICICI Bank Credit Cards","₹4000 off on Axis and ICICI Bank Credit Cards","₹1250 off on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Cards","₹4000 off on Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Cards","5% Cashback on Flipkart Axis Bank Card","15% off on first Pay Later Order"],"categoryPath":"Electronics>Cameras & Accessories>Cameras>DSLR & Mirrorless","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"","sellerName":"Satvinder Singh","sellerAverageRating":null,"sellerNoOfRatings":0,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["Effective Pixels: 16.2 MP","Sensor Type: CMOS | LCD Size: 3 inch","Max Shutter Speed: 1/4000","Auto Focus"],"detailedSpecs":["Effective Pixels: 16.2 MP","Sensor Type: CMOS | LCD Size: 3 inch","Max Shutter Speed: 1/4000","Auto Focus"],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Sales Package","value":["Body Cap BF-1B, Rubber Eyecup DK-20, Battery Charger MH-24, Camera Body, ViewNX 2 CD, User Manual, Rechargeable Li-ion Battery EN-EL14, AF-S 18-55mm VR Kit Lens, Strap AN-DC3, Eyepiece Cap DK-5, Audio Video Cable EG-CP14, Accessory Shoe Cover BS-1, USB Cable UC-E6"]},{"key":"Model Name","value":["D5100"]},{"key":"Series","value":["Nikon"]},{"key":"Type","value":["DSLR"]},{"key":"Effective Pixel","value":["16.2 MP"]},{"key":"Wifi","value":["No"]},{"key":"Screen Resolution Type","value":["Full HD"]},{"key":"Lens Attachment","value":["Body Only"]},{"key":"Maximum Shutter Speed","value":["1/4000 sec"]}]},{"key":"Sensor and Sensitivity Features","values":[{"key":"Sensor Type","value":["CMOS"]},{"key":"Sensor Size","value":["23.6 x 15.8 mm"]},{"key":"Maximum ISO","value":["6400"]},{"key":"Maximum FPS","value":["4 fps"]},{"key":"Sensor Technology","value":["CMOS"]},{"key":"Metering","value":["3D color matrix metering II"]}]},{"key":"Focus Features","values":[{"key":"Auto Focus","value":["Yes"]},{"key":"Manual Focus","value":["Yes"]}]},{"key":"Lens & Exposure Features","values":[{"key":"Type of Lens","value":["Nikon F mount"]},{"key":"Lens Focal Length","value":["Approx. 1.5x lens focal length"]},{"key":"Minimum Shutter Speed","value":["30 sec"]}]},{"key":"Modes and Functions","values":[{"key":"Built-in Flash","value":["Yes"]},{"key":"Flash Modes","value":["Fill-flash, slow sync, auto slow sync, red-eye reduction, auto with red-eye reduction, slow sync with red-eye reduction, auto, slow sync with red-eye reduction, rear-curtain sync, rear-curtain with slow sync."]},{"key":"HD Support","value":["Yes"]},{"key":"Delete Function","value":["Yes"]},{"key":"Self-timer","value":["Yes"]},{"key":"Red Eye Reduction","value":["Yes"]},{"key":"Sync Terminal","value":["1/200 sec"]},{"key":"Picture Angle","value":["Approx. 1.5x lens focal length"]},{"key":"White Balancing","value":["Auto (TTL white-balance with main image sensor and 420-pixel RGB sensor), Incandescent, Fluorescent ( 7 types ), Direct, Sunlight, Flash, Cloudy, Shade, preset manual."]},{"key":"Shooting Modes","value":["Single frame, Continuous: 4fps, Self-timer, Delayed remote, Quick-response remote, Silent shuttle release, D-Movie."]}]},{"key":"Audio and Video Features","values":[{"key":"Video Format","value":["MOV movie (H.264, MPEG-4 AVC compression format with Linear PCM sound;

TG-5(12 MP, 4x Optical Zoom, 4x Digital Zoom, Black)","productDescription":"Designed for the adventurous type, the black Tough TG-5 Digital Camera from Olympus is a durable point-and-shoot with a rugged physical construction and apt imaging capabilities. Utilizing a 12MP BSI CMOS sensor and TruePic VIII image processor, the TG-5 offers notable image clarity and low-light performance, to ISO 12800, along with fast 20 fps continuous shooting, 4K/30p video recording, and high-speed Full HD 1080p shooting at 120 fps. Balancing the imaging capabilities is a versatile 4x optical zoom lens, which spans a 25-100mm equivalent range, and has an f/2 maximum aperture to benefit working in low-light conditions. Additionally, the Variable Macro System also positions this lens for close-up shooting with subjects just one centimeter away for true macro photography. Complementing the sensor and optical attributes of the TG-5 is a robust set of features for withstanding the elements, tracking your adventures, and sharing your images. The camera is rated for underwater use, as well as tested to withstand falls and crushing, and is hermetically sealed against dust and moisture for assured use in trying conditions. Making use of these stats, a Field Sensor System incorporates GPS, a manometer, compass, and a thermometer for recording the details of your environment and embedding this data onto your photos and movies. Using built-in Wi-Fi and the OI.Track app, the recording log data and the imagery can be shared to a mobile device for compositing and sharing online.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/jp5sknk0/point-shoot-camera/q/a/z/tg-5-t-series-v104190bu000-olympus-original-imafbchzbdb7bgms.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/jp5sknk0/point-shoot-camera/q/a/z/tg-5-t-series-v104190bu000-olympus-original-imafbchzbdb7bgms.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/jp5sknk0/point-shoot-camera/q/a/z/tg-5-t-series-v104190bu000-olympus-original-imafbchzbdb7bgms.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["POIFBCMFJCY9YQAZ"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":32290,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":32290,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":27999,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/olympus-tg-5/p/itmfbfsxtjfhka6g?pid=POIFBCMFJCY9YQAZ&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"OLYMPUS","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":13,"offers":["10%
