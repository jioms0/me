Easy in, Easy out: • Plugging the USB 3.0 cable from the hub connects users to their entire desktop peripheral environment. No external power supply unit is required, and there is no need to plug in or install anything else before you connect any device or external storage. What is USB 2.0 or 3.0? : •The Oxyura USB hubs and cables have different version numbers (2.0 and 3.0) that indicates their transfer speed. The higher the version number, the faster they can work. However, to get the full power, the host and the device must have the same version. If not, the lowest USB version in the chain will control the speed. For example, if your computer has a 2.0 USB port, your cable is 3.0, and your phone is 3.0, you will achieve 2.0 speed. If all three (computer, cable, and phone) all have 3.0 then you will have 3.0 speed.
