iMac and Mac mini systems shipped in 2011 and newer. One of the best ways to improve your Mac's performance. Applications use memory, and some of the applications that run best on the Mac photo and video editing . That's why outfitting your Mac with a Corcair Mac Memory upgrade kit is one of the best things you can do to maximize your system's performance and ability. With a Mac that's been upgraded to the maximum amount of memory it supports, you'll spend less time waiting for your applications to buffer data to the hard drive, and more time working or playing. Upgrading memory can also be a cost-effective way to get more life out of your older system: before you trade up to a new one, just upgrade the memory.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/ram/a/a/3/corsair-cmsa8gx3m1a1600c11-original-imadvy5jqfpx66qp.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/ram/a/a/3/corsair-cmsa8gx3m1a1600c11-original-imadvy5jqfpx66qp.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/ram/a/a/3/corsair-cmsa8gx3m1a1600c11-original-imadvy5jqfpx66qp.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["RAMEES2MDWYHJEVA"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":3300,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":3300,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":3199,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/corsair-apple-mac-series-ddr3-8-gb-dual-channel-laptop-cmsa8gx3m1a1600c11/p/itmdvydsdh3kjshf?pid=RAMDVYDSATNUAAA3&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"CORSAIR","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":3,"offers":["5% Cashback on Flipkart Axis Bank Card","20%off on 1st txn with Amex Network Cards T&C","10% Off on BOB Mastercard debit card","10% Off on ICICI Bank Mastercard Credit Card","₹50 Off on ICICI Bank Mastercard Debit Card"],"categoryPath":"Computers>Computer Components>RAMs","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"","sellerName":"KALPESH","sellerAverageRating":null,"sellerNoOfRatings":0,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["Data rate: DDR3","Number of Channels: Dual Channel","Compatible Device: Laptop"],"detailedSpecs":["Data rate: DDR3","Number of Channels: Dual Channel","Compatible Device: Laptop"],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Brand","value":["CORSAIR"]},{"key":"Memory Type","value":["8 GB DDR3"]},{"key":"Compatible Device","value":["Laptop"]},{"key":"Model ID","value":["CMSA8GX3M1A1600C11"]},{"key":"Series","value":["Apple Mac Series"]}]},{"key":"Memory","values":[{"key":"Memory Configuration","value":["NA"]}]},{"key":"Warranty","values":[{"key":"Service Type","value":["10 Years Corsair Domestic, Carry In, Repair/Replacement Warranty at Kaizen Infoserve.

is an extreme performance, all-in-one liquid CPU cooler for cases with 240mm radiator mounts. The 240mm radiator and dual SP120L PWM fans provide the excellent heat dissipation you need for highly overclocked CPUs. Corsair Link is built in, so you can monitor temperatures, adjust cooling performance and customize LED lighting directly from your desktop. Built-in Corsair Link for monitoring, customization, and control Attach the included Corsair Link cable to a USB header on your motherboard and download the free Corsair Link software to unlock even more power.

Advanced SP120L PWM fans Our custom-designed SP120L fans are different than standard case fans – they’re custom-designed to deliver high static pressure for mounting directly against radiators, and the fan blades are specially shaped for maximum air delivery with minimum noise. Since they’re PWM controlled, you can customize the fan speed to choose the optimal point on

Each memory module is rated at 2400MHz to greatly increase data transmission efficiency by higher bandwidth of up to 19GB/s. Operated at a nominal voltage of just 1.2V, Transcend's DDR4 SO-DIMM JetRam memory ensures that both operating temperature and electrical load on the memory controller can be reduced in order to save up to 40% of energy compared to standard DDR3 modules offering 1.5V.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/jeiukcw0/ram/x/g/4/transcend-ddr4-2400-mhz-original-imaf35w4qhpu9umd.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/jeiukcw0/ram/x/g/4/transcend-ddr4-2400-mhz-original-imaf35w4qhpu9umd.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/jeiukcw0/ram/x/g/4/transcend-ddr4-2400-mhz-original-imaf35w4qhpu9umd.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["RAMF35WSDZETZXG4"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":8999,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":8999,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":4200,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/transcend-jm2400hsb-8g-ddr4-8-gb-laptop-sd-ram-ddr4-2400-mhz/p/itmf3687jus4xate?pid=RAMF35WSDZETZXG4&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"Transcend","inStock":true,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":51,"offers":["5%

Uncontrolled heat generated by electronic devices will not only decrease the performance of any system, but will ultimately lead to complete system failure. In order to prevent this catastrophe from occurring, it is imperative that your equipment be designed with an efficient cooling system in mind. This system will not only be crucial to heat dissipation but will also contribute to the stability and long life of the equipment itself. This is where a DC fan with a well designed cooling path becomes one of the most important components of any equipment. Heat dissipation for the prevention of premature failure is by far the most crucial part of any electronic system design, and a DC fan is one of the best tools available to keep your electronic devices performing at top operational shape. Axial fans blow air along the axis of the fan, or parallel to the track of the blade axis. DC fan functions best under a low pressure or low system impedance environment. With reduced fan speed the noise produced by an axial fan can be kept at a minimum. Because of this low level of audible noise, as well as their economical price range, this kind of fan is extensively used in PCs, for both CPU and power supply cooling.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/j5lchow0/cooler/d/e/m/maa-ku-dc6020-original-imaew9fsezpcfwpk.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/j5lchow0/cooler/d/e/m/maa-ku-dc6020-original-imaew9fsezpcfwpk.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/j5lchow0/cooler/d/e/m/maa-ku-dc6020-original-imaew9fsezpcfwpk.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["COLEW99GSJQ8DDEM"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":1000,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":1000,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":300,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/maa-ku-dc6020-cooler/p/itmew99gb8vmhbgz?pid=COLEW99GSJQ8DDEM&affid=onlinesho41","productBrand":"Maa-Ku","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":70,"offers":["5%
